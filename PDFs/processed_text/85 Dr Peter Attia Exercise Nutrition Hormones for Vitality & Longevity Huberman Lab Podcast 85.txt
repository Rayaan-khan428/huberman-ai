$200 off mattress order two free pillows. now discussion
Dr. Peter Attia. Peter, thanks joining today. - Thanks me, man. -
looking forward long time. - [Peter] I. - huge fan
podcast. know went Stanford worked number people
colleagues mine. me, already thrill, just this. -
Yeah, well, likewise. - ton questions, want start off something
wonder lot about, know many people wonder about,
assess current health trajectory terms health wellbeing,
specifically relates blood work. thoughts blood work?
necessary typical person? somebody not dealing
acute syndrome illness. age suggest people start getting blood
work? frequently get blood work? often get blood work
done, et cetera? - Yeah, lot there. mean, way talk patients
is, first, taking everything back objective. thing trying
optimize? person says, look, trying break 10 hours Ironman, don't
know blood work going game-changing aspect trajectory
training. know, going benefit much sort functional analyses
performance. assuming, based question, really coming
lens living longer living better lifespan health span
lens? - Mostly, yeah. think people sense vitality lack
vitality, think everyone wonders whether not feel better, whether
not blood work will give window might go feeling better. -
Yeah, think extent, also think lot blind spots.
kind break things two vectors make longevity, lifespan
health span. lifespan easiest vectors understand,
pretty binary. alive not alive. respiring not. make
ATP don't, end story. gets way lifespan essentially four
horsemen disease, right? atherosclerotic disease, cancer, neurodegenerative


disease, metabolic disease, directly isn't cause many deaths,
basically creates foundation diseases. So, know,
non-smoker, just rattled off 80% death. blood work
help address those? varies. atherosclerotic standpoint, good
predictor risk, know look for. primarily ApoB single
important lipoprotein care about. can explain means
second. also, markers inflammation, endothelial health, metabolic
health. comes cancer, know, blood testing sense biomarkers
not particularly helpful, outside knowing second leading environmental
modifiable cause cancer metabolic ill health, smoking. don't actually
know lot cancer sense causes it. really stochastic, lot
bad luck. know smoking drives it, know that, even though
epidemiologically say obesity drives it, really means metabolic poor health.
probably hyperinsulinemia comes obesity drives it. biomarkers
help that, still enormous blind spot cancer. talk
liquid biopsies aside, 'cause aren't really biomarker studies, put away.
neurodegenerative side, know, don't think lot insight comes
understanding Parkinson's disease, comes dementia, particularly
Alzheimer's disease, prevalent form dementia, think
biomarkers can quite helpful. overlap lot atherosclerotic diseases.
things drive risk heart disease driving risk dementia.
novel stuff well, include genetic testing, can get
blood test. get whole suite genes, not just APOE, far nuanced
stuff that, can also play role. can stratify risk sense.
aggregate, say, know,

00:11:51 Healthspan: Functional Testing, Cognitive & Emotional States

blood testing biomarkers provides pretty good insight lifespan. get
health span, kind cognitive, physical, emotional domains. think
biomarkers far less helpful, kind rely functional testing.
comes sort cognitive piece, know, can cognitive testing.
terms long-term risk, lot things imply good cognitive health age,
line things reduce risk dementia.


biomarkers look improve dementia risk reduction,
improving cognitive health. physical side, mean, outside
looking hormone levels things look extensively, understanding
might aid prevent metrics matter, really is,
biomarker aside thing. mean, much interested person's DEXA, CPET
testing, VO2 max testing, know, zone two lactate testing, fat oxidation.
consider functional tests give far insight that.
course emotional piece, depending are, might
single important piece, without none stuff matters, right?
totally miserable human being, relationships suck, don't think
stuff matters. certainly nothing looking biomarkers
giving great insight that. - ask emotional state, try
assess emotional state indirectly intake one patients? -
Probably not much intake, think takes form relationship
patient starts become something necessarily going
want talk about. definitely think important part do.
think without it, none stuff really matters. Again, irony thinking
many years spent sort pursuit fully optimizing every detail
everything, without attention paid dimension, not lost me.
look, patients who, just not something that, something
compartmentalized. Maybe they're, know,

00:13:59 Blood Testing: Best Frequency

well department, maybe aren't, just aren't willing
engage yet. - terms frequency blood testing, somebody feels pretty
good taking number steps, exercise, nutrition, et cetera, try extend
lifespan improve health span, year frequent enough, 20-
year-old start getting blood work done just get window going on?
Assuming can afford insurance can cover it. - Yeah, mean, look,
certainly think everybody screened early life look at, like,
single prevalent genetic driver atherosclerosis, Lp[a].
unfortunately physicians don't know Lp[a] is, yet somewhere
eight 12% population high enough, depending you,


know, recent guest podcast suggested high 20%,
high enough Lp[a], contributing atherosclerosis. not want
know that, genetically determined, right, something that, born
need really check once, wouldn't want know
20-year-old, can contribute lot early atherosclerosis see people.
leaving money table, opinion. frequency need test
really comes state interventions. don't think makes sense just
blood tests sake blood tests. kind reason.
something changing? know, blood test is, part, static intervention.
look window time. benefit
course year, unsure level. something comes back
doesn't look great, yeah, might make sense just recheck without reacting it.
typically, know, patients, might check blood two four times year,
also probably things now check, like hey, know, gave drug,
desired outcome? put three pounds muscle

00:16:01 DEXA Scan: Lean Mass & Fat, Bone Mineral Density & Osteoporosis

lost three pounds fat, desired outcome? - Speaking tracking
weight fat, lean mass percentages, something recommend
patients pretty often? know people step scale every day, know people
like frankly, might step scale three times year. don't really care.
pay attention things far subjective. Maybe making huge
mistake. thoughts quantitative measurements weight, BMI,
typical person? - think pretty crude. think DEXA, rather take DEXA
annually, maybe follow weight little bit closely get sense it.
DEXA getting, least way look data, four pieces
information. Now, people DEXA, explain is, I'm?
- Yeah, think people might not know DEXA is. fact, confess,
crude understanding is. Tell wrong, hopefully
least partially right. understanding number different ways
measure lean mass non-lean mass ratio, one put
underwater. one put sort non-underwater chamber.
calipering. looking mirror pinching changing


lighting. - know, funny, done enough, can, can sort tell
body fat abs, right. can sort tell by, know, good six pack
bad six pack is, leanness is. actually not terrible way
it. bodybuilder, example, never been, can tell difference
6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, just based degree visibility within abs.
basically, DEXA scan x-ray. principle just getting chest x-
ray, ionizing radiation passed body. plate behind
body collects comes through. denser medium electrons
trying go through, less collected. look x-
ray, everybody's probably seen x-ray, white dense.
had, know, piece metal pocket, show bright white thing.
ribs bones show white, things least dense, like
lungs, just air, blackest. everything shade gray
between. DEXA just effectively, moving x-ray. lay
bed takes maybe 10 minutes, little, low power x-ray kind
goes body. plate beneath collecting information basically
allowing differentiate three things, bone mineral content, fat, other.
quantified lean body mass. organs, muscles, everything else.
people DEXA, get report back, reports horrible.
yet see one company can way isn't abjectly horrible.
created templates, dashboard this, 'cause
just given trying use theirs. first thing people look
body fat. gold standard outside like MRI something,
used research purposes. DEXA going produce far better estimate
body fat, calipers buoyancy testing, things like that, provided machinery
well-calibrated, operator knows use it. heard people argue
hands like guy calipers whole life, probably
comparable calipers. nevertheless, off-the-shelf tech, DEXA amazing.
four things get spit DEXA, think body fat least
interesting. rank fourth list germane
health. three things get spit bone mineral density, visceral fat,
metrics allow compute, like basically compute called
appendicular lean mass index fat-free mass index. three metrics
significantly important body fat. reason follows, right? So, bone


mineral density basically speaks risk osteoporosis osteopenia.
doesn't sound sexy people age, know. 50-year-old guys listening this,
like, yeah, big deal. 50-year-old woman, huge deal, right? woman
just go menopause, just gone menopause,
enormous risk osteopenia, ultimately osteoporosis, estrogen
single important hormone regulating bone mineral density. can come
back talk case, interesting biomechanics
bones work, estrogen specifically important. huge cause
morbidity, right? So, know, age 65 fall break
hip, one year morbidity 30 40%. again, just put English,
65 older, fall break hip, 30 40% chance dead
year. - [Andrew] Wow. - Bones matter. want really get sense
stack age, sex. anywhere off pace,
ramp strategy super aggressive increase that,
minimum, prevent decay. - age-related charts sorts
things? - Yeah, gets spit called Z-score. looking
BMD, going give Z-score. Z-score zero means,
understand this, like, Z-score referring probability distribution standard
mode. Z-score zero means 50th percentile age sex. Z-
score plus one, one standard deviation above, minus one, below, et cetera.
also T-score, thing, comparing young
person. T-score technically used make diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis. tend look Z-score, basically say, look, Z-
score right now minus one, four years want Z-score zero. Not
necessarily increased entire way, maybe increased
slightly

00:22:33 Bone Mineral Density & Age-Related Decline, Strength Training,
Corticosteroids

expected would've declined. - see. things can
improve bone mineral density age? - turns real critical
window malleable. depending age someone's
listening us discuss this, know, 20, 25, still time


life able reach potential. turns strength training
probably single best thing can do. surprise me, 'cause we,
know, AMA topic little ago, got really deep
analysts. assumption running must best, like sort
impact must best thing can do. know, assumed running better
swimming cycling. turned power lifting probably best
thing do. think understand bones work, became
clear, is, know, power lifting really putting sheer force
muscle via tendon onto bone, bones really sensing.
sensing sheer force applied bone, compressive
way, depending bone course. basically activating
osteoblasts, cells allowing bone built. turns
probably important females, high can get period
development, say till 20 25, basically sets trajectory rest
life. get real trouble patients who, example, used large
amounts inhaled steroids period life, 'cause say really
bad asthma. patients needed large amounts corticosteroids
immune-related condition. critical window development,
taking drug impairing process. So, know, patients like
practice just enormous liability working really hard
overcome, nutrition, hormones, drugs, training. And, know,
just something aware of. - wasn't aware inhalants asthma
things sort can impair bone mineral density. - steroid-based.
course just beta-agonists, fine. - anything corticosteroid like?
- Yep. - Interesting. always get asked question, always reflexively
want say no, don't really know answer don't reply. topical
corticosteroid? know, people will put cortisone cream. me, seems almost
inconceivable systemic effect, again, know? -
dose time-related. So, know, talking like got little rash
skin, going put corticosteroids on, probably not. certainly,
enough put on, mean absorbed, issue. not typically
concerned with. mean, mostly concerned people taking
even modest amounts prednisone months, years time. Or, like said, kids
using steroid inhalers years years years. Again, not suggesting


kid's steroid inhaler shouldn't be. solve important
problem, asthma important problem, it. think just want
turn into, okay, well, much imperative kid things
putting high amount stress bones, via muscles, make sure
maximal capacity build. - think somebody 30s 40s
50s still benefit strength training terms bone mineral density
longevity, relates bone mineral density, given key window earlier,
might missed one. - Oh yeah, no, no, essential rest life
now trying prevent fall off. basically way works
sort of, birth say 20 growth. 20 50, plateau. 50, men
start decline, really small. Women start decline precipitous. -
related drop estrogen associated menopause premenopause? - [Peter]
Correct. - can get broad contours strength training
looks like? Dr. Andy Galpin show, talked lot ways build
strength versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera. think pretty good
agreement across fields physiotherapy, et cetera, physiology medicine,
terms that. understanding fairly low repetition ranges,
anywhere one six repetitions. Typically not aiming pump hypertrophy,
sort thing. heavy loads hard move, 80% one repetition maximum
more, done long rest periods, two three times week type thing,
right? - Yeah, look literature this, going tell you, going
differentiate power lifting weightlifting. words, yeah, need kind
moving heavy load. Now again, can look different depending
level experience. Like really like deadlifting. Now, mean, can count
number days left life going want sets 400 pounds. But,
know, pick choose days do. But, know, grew
things, comfortable movements. 60-year-old woman never
lifted weights life, now get lifting, mean, get
deadlift, think, wouldn't make perfect enemy good. happy put
leg press machine just get that. know, not pure
movement deadlift, cares, right? can still put heavy load,
her, safely. So, now said, mean, study done
Australia, I'm, know, hopefully can find link it. video
YouTube actually kind PI sort walking results. send


you. - [Andrew] Okay, yeah track down. - just amazing. took
group older women. looked like 60s 70s, never
lifted weights life, osteopenia, probably already
osteoporosis, basically just put strength training protocol.
remarkable watch women. good mornings. dead
lifts. picking heavy things off ground. think one woman picking up,
God, want say like picking like 50, 60 kilos off ground. mean, just
staggering sums weight women never done anything.
bone health improving age. goal, frankly, just, know, never get
point first time. Strength training
essential part existence

00:29:24 Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training

never late start, never stop. - love advice.
systemic effect local effect? So, instance, say that, well, mother's
late 70s. actually used really strong kids. move
fish tank room long move it, always, really
strong. years, wouldn't call frail means, certainly think
benefit strength training. say start leg
presses start even air squats maybe work pushups,
effects local, meaning just train legs just pushups,
loads applied limbs muscles tissues involved? -
think bulk is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Andrew] need train
whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep mind, diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis based three locations, left hip, right hip, lumbar
spine. So, know, just convention make diagnosis.
think part majority insults occur. Now not
insults, seen people have, know, horrible bone density,
fracturing ankles tibia, fibula, like low tib fib fractures just
walking. clearly bone density outside regions matter. much
really focused on, and, way, know, fall, break wrist,
systemic issue. majority response local response, 'cause really
comes putting load



00:31:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

directly bone, bone, kind, respond laying
bone. - continue today's discussion, like just briefly acknowledge
sponsor Athletic Greens, now called AG1. Athletic Greens, aka AG1, all-in-one

K2 cardiovascular health calcium regulation.

00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining “Marginal Decade”

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

00:07:29 Lifespan: Bloodwork & Biomarkers Testing, “4 Horseman Disease”

$200 off mattress order two free pillows. now discussion
Dr. Peter Attia. Peter, thanks joining today. - Thanks me, man. -
looking forward long time. - [Peter] I. - huge fan
podcast. know went Stanford worked number people
colleagues mine. me, already thrill, just this. -
Yeah, well, likewise. - ton questions, want start off something
wonder lot about, know many people wonder about,
assess current health trajectory terms health wellbeing,
specifically relates blood work. thoughts blood work?
necessary typical person? somebody not dealing
acute syndrome illness. age suggest people start getting blood
work? frequently get blood work? often get blood work
done, et cetera? - Yeah, lot there. mean, way talk patients
is, first, taking everything back objective. thing trying
optimize? person says, look, trying break 10 hours Ironman, don't
know blood work going game-changing aspect trajectory
training. know, going benefit much sort functional analyses
performance. assuming, based question, really coming
lens living longer living better lifespan health span
lens? - Mostly, yeah. think people sense vitality lack
vitality, think everyone wonders whether not feel better, whether
not blood work will give window might go feeling better. -
Yeah, think extent, also think lot blind spots.
kind break things two vectors make longevity, lifespan
health span. lifespan easiest vectors understand,
pretty binary. alive not alive. respiring not. make
ATP don't, end story. gets way lifespan essentially four
horsemen disease, right? atherosclerotic disease, cancer, neurodegenerative


disease, metabolic disease, directly isn't cause many deaths,
basically creates foundation diseases. So, know,
non-smoker, just rattled off 80% death. blood work
help address those? varies. atherosclerotic standpoint, good
predictor risk, know look for. primarily ApoB single
important lipoprotein care about. can explain means
second. also, markers inflammation, endothelial health, metabolic
health. comes cancer, know, blood testing sense biomarkers
not particularly helpful, outside knowing second leading environmental
modifiable cause cancer metabolic ill health, smoking. don't actually
know lot cancer sense causes it. really stochastic, lot
bad luck. know smoking drives it, know that, even though
epidemiologically say obesity drives it, really means metabolic poor health.
probably hyperinsulinemia comes obesity drives it. biomarkers
help that, still enormous blind spot cancer. talk
liquid biopsies aside, 'cause aren't really biomarker studies, put away.
neurodegenerative side, know, don't think lot insight comes
understanding Parkinson's disease, comes dementia, particularly
Alzheimer's disease, prevalent form dementia, think
biomarkers can quite helpful. overlap lot atherosclerotic diseases.
things drive risk heart disease driving risk dementia.
novel stuff well, include genetic testing, can get
blood test. get whole suite genes, not just APOE, far nuanced
stuff that, can also play role. can stratify risk sense.
aggregate, say, know,

00:11:51 Healthspan: Functional Testing, Cognitive & Emotional States

blood testing biomarkers provides pretty good insight lifespan. get
health span, kind cognitive, physical, emotional domains. think
biomarkers far less helpful, kind rely functional testing.
comes sort cognitive piece, know, can cognitive testing.
terms long-term risk, lot things imply good cognitive health age,
line things reduce risk dementia.


biomarkers look improve dementia risk reduction,
improving cognitive health. physical side, mean, outside
looking hormone levels things look extensively, understanding
might aid prevent metrics matter, really is,
biomarker aside thing. mean, much interested person's DEXA, CPET
testing, VO2 max testing, know, zone two lactate testing, fat oxidation.
consider functional tests give far insight that.
course emotional piece, depending are, might
single important piece, without none stuff matters, right?
totally miserable human being, relationships suck, don't think
stuff matters. certainly nothing looking biomarkers
giving great insight that. - ask emotional state, try
assess emotional state indirectly intake one patients? -
Probably not much intake, think takes form relationship
patient starts become something necessarily going
want talk about. definitely think important part do.
think without it, none stuff really matters. Again, irony thinking
many years spent sort pursuit fully optimizing every detail
everything, without attention paid dimension, not lost me.
look, patients who, just not something that, something
compartmentalized. Maybe they're, know,

00:13:59 Blood Testing: Best Frequency

well department, maybe aren't, just aren't willing
engage yet. - terms frequency blood testing, somebody feels pretty
good taking number steps, exercise, nutrition, et cetera, try extend
lifespan improve health span, year frequent enough, 20-
year-old start getting blood work done just get window going on?
Assuming can afford insurance can cover it. - Yeah, mean, look,
certainly think everybody screened early life look at, like,
single prevalent genetic driver atherosclerosis, Lp[a].
unfortunately physicians don't know Lp[a] is, yet somewhere
eight 12% population high enough, depending you,


know, recent guest podcast suggested high 20%,
high enough Lp[a], contributing atherosclerosis. not want
know that, genetically determined, right, something that, born
need really check once, wouldn't want know
20-year-old, can contribute lot early atherosclerosis see people.
leaving money table, opinion. frequency need test
really comes state interventions. don't think makes sense just
blood tests sake blood tests. kind reason.
something changing? know, blood test is, part, static intervention.
look window time. benefit
course year, unsure level. something comes back
doesn't look great, yeah, might make sense just recheck without reacting it.
typically, know, patients, might check blood two four times year,
also probably things now check, like hey, know, gave drug,
desired outcome? put three pounds muscle

00:16:01 DEXA Scan: Lean Mass & Fat, Bone Mineral Density & Osteoporosis

lost three pounds fat, desired outcome? - Speaking tracking
weight fat, lean mass percentages, something recommend
patients pretty often? know people step scale every day, know people
like frankly, might step scale three times year. don't really care.
pay attention things far subjective. Maybe making huge
mistake. thoughts quantitative measurements weight, BMI,
typical person? - think pretty crude. think DEXA, rather take DEXA
annually, maybe follow weight little bit closely get sense it.
DEXA getting, least way look data, four pieces
information. Now, people DEXA, explain is, I'm?
- Yeah, think people might not know DEXA is. fact, confess,
crude understanding is. Tell wrong, hopefully
least partially right. understanding number different ways
measure lean mass non-lean mass ratio, one put
underwater. one put sort non-underwater chamber.
calipering. looking mirror pinching changing


lighting. - know, funny, done enough, can, can sort tell
body fat abs, right. can sort tell by, know, good six pack
bad six pack is, leanness is. actually not terrible way
it. bodybuilder, example, never been, can tell difference
6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, just based degree visibility within abs.
basically, DEXA scan x-ray. principle just getting chest x-
ray, ionizing radiation passed body. plate behind
body collects comes through. denser medium electrons
trying go through, less collected. look x-
ray, everybody's probably seen x-ray, white dense.
had, know, piece metal pocket, show bright white thing.
ribs bones show white, things least dense, like
lungs, just air, blackest. everything shade gray
between. DEXA just effectively, moving x-ray. lay
bed takes maybe 10 minutes, little, low power x-ray kind
goes body. plate beneath collecting information basically
allowing differentiate three things, bone mineral content, fat, other.
quantified lean body mass. organs, muscles, everything else.
people DEXA, get report back, reports horrible.
yet see one company can way isn't abjectly horrible.
created templates, dashboard this, 'cause
just given trying use theirs. first thing people look
body fat. gold standard outside like MRI something,
used research purposes. DEXA going produce far better estimate
body fat, calipers buoyancy testing, things like that, provided machinery
well-calibrated, operator knows use it. heard people argue
hands like guy calipers whole life, probably
comparable calipers. nevertheless, off-the-shelf tech, DEXA amazing.
four things get spit DEXA, think body fat least
interesting. rank fourth list germane
health. three things get spit bone mineral density, visceral fat,
metrics allow compute, like basically compute called
appendicular lean mass index fat-free mass index. three metrics
significantly important body fat. reason follows, right? So, bone


mineral density basically speaks risk osteoporosis osteopenia.
doesn't sound sexy people age, know. 50-year-old guys listening this,
like, yeah, big deal. 50-year-old woman, huge deal, right? woman
just go menopause, just gone menopause,
enormous risk osteopenia, ultimately osteoporosis, estrogen
single important hormone regulating bone mineral density. can come
back talk case, interesting biomechanics
bones work, estrogen specifically important. huge cause
morbidity, right? So, know, age 65 fall break
hip, one year morbidity 30 40%. again, just put English,
65 older, fall break hip, 30 40% chance dead
year. - [Andrew] Wow. - Bones matter. want really get sense
stack age, sex. anywhere off pace,
ramp strategy super aggressive increase that,
minimum, prevent decay. - age-related charts sorts
things? - Yeah, gets spit called Z-score. looking
BMD, going give Z-score. Z-score zero means,
understand this, like, Z-score referring probability distribution standard
mode. Z-score zero means 50th percentile age sex. Z-
score plus one, one standard deviation above, minus one, below, et cetera.
also T-score, thing, comparing young
person. T-score technically used make diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis. tend look Z-score, basically say, look, Z-
score right now minus one, four years want Z-score zero. Not
necessarily increased entire way, maybe increased
slightly

00:22:33 Bone Mineral Density & Age-Related Decline, Strength Training,
Corticosteroids

expected would've declined. - see. things can
improve bone mineral density age? - turns real critical
window malleable. depending age someone's
listening us discuss this, know, 20, 25, still time


life able reach potential. turns strength training
probably single best thing can do. surprise me, 'cause we,
know, AMA topic little ago, got really deep
analysts. assumption running must best, like sort
impact must best thing can do. know, assumed running better
swimming cycling. turned power lifting probably best
thing do. think understand bones work, became
clear, is, know, power lifting really putting sheer force
muscle via tendon onto bone, bones really sensing.
sensing sheer force applied bone, compressive
way, depending bone course. basically activating
osteoblasts, cells allowing bone built. turns
probably important females, high can get period
development, say till 20 25, basically sets trajectory rest
life. get real trouble patients who, example, used large
amounts inhaled steroids period life, 'cause say really
bad asthma. patients needed large amounts corticosteroids
immune-related condition. critical window development,
taking drug impairing process. So, know, patients like
practice just enormous liability working really hard
overcome, nutrition, hormones, drugs, training. And, know,
just something aware of. - wasn't aware inhalants asthma
things sort can impair bone mineral density. - steroid-based.
course just beta-agonists, fine. - anything corticosteroid like?
- Yep. - Interesting. always get asked question, always reflexively
want say no, don't really know answer don't reply. topical
corticosteroid? know, people will put cortisone cream. me, seems almost
inconceivable systemic effect, again, know? -
dose time-related. So, know, talking like got little rash
skin, going put corticosteroids on, probably not. certainly,
enough put on, mean absorbed, issue. not typically
concerned with. mean, mostly concerned people taking
even modest amounts prednisone months, years time. Or, like said, kids
using steroid inhalers years years years. Again, not suggesting


kid's steroid inhaler shouldn't be. solve important
problem, asthma important problem, it. think just want
turn into, okay, well, much imperative kid things
putting high amount stress bones, via muscles, make sure
maximal capacity build. - think somebody 30s 40s
50s still benefit strength training terms bone mineral density
longevity, relates bone mineral density, given key window earlier,
might missed one. - Oh yeah, no, no, essential rest life
now trying prevent fall off. basically way works
sort of, birth say 20 growth. 20 50, plateau. 50, men
start decline, really small. Women start decline precipitous. -
related drop estrogen associated menopause premenopause? - [Peter]
Correct. - can get broad contours strength training
looks like? Dr. Andy Galpin show, talked lot ways build
strength versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera. think pretty good
agreement across fields physiotherapy, et cetera, physiology medicine,
terms that. understanding fairly low repetition ranges,
anywhere one six repetitions. Typically not aiming pump hypertrophy,
sort thing. heavy loads hard move, 80% one repetition maximum
more, done long rest periods, two three times week type thing,
right? - Yeah, look literature this, going tell you, going
differentiate power lifting weightlifting. words, yeah, need kind
moving heavy load. Now again, can look different depending
level experience. Like really like deadlifting. Now, mean, can count
number days left life going want sets 400 pounds. But,
know, pick choose days do. But, know, grew
things, comfortable movements. 60-year-old woman never
lifted weights life, now get lifting, mean, get
deadlift, think, wouldn't make perfect enemy good. happy put
leg press machine just get that. know, not pure
movement deadlift, cares, right? can still put heavy load,
her, safely. So, now said, mean, study done
Australia, I'm, know, hopefully can find link it. video
YouTube actually kind PI sort walking results. send


you. - [Andrew] Okay, yeah track down. - just amazing. took
group older women. looked like 60s 70s, never
lifted weights life, osteopenia, probably already
osteoporosis, basically just put strength training protocol.
remarkable watch women. good mornings. dead
lifts. picking heavy things off ground. think one woman picking up,
God, want say like picking like 50, 60 kilos off ground. mean, just
staggering sums weight women never done anything.
bone health improving age. goal, frankly, just, know, never get
point first time. Strength training
essential part existence

00:29:24 Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training

never late start, never stop. - love advice.
systemic effect local effect? So, instance, say that, well, mother's
late 70s. actually used really strong kids. move
fish tank room long move it, always, really
strong. years, wouldn't call frail means, certainly think
benefit strength training. say start leg
presses start even air squats maybe work pushups,
effects local, meaning just train legs just pushups,
loads applied limbs muscles tissues involved? -
think bulk is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Andrew] need train
whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep mind, diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis based three locations, left hip, right hip, lumbar
spine. So, know, just convention make diagnosis.
think part majority insults occur. Now not
insults, seen people have, know, horrible bone density,
fracturing ankles tibia, fibula, like low tib fib fractures just
walking. clearly bone density outside regions matter. much
really focused on, and, way, know, fall, break wrist,
systemic issue. majority response local response, 'cause really
comes putting load



00:31:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

directly bone, bone, kind, respond laying
bone. - continue today's discussion, like just briefly acknowledge
sponsor Athletic Greens, now called AG1. Athletic Greens, aka AG1, all-in-one

00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining “Marginal Decade”

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

00:07:29 Lifespan: Bloodwork & Biomarkers Testing, “4 Horseman Disease”

$200 off mattress order two free pillows. now discussion
Dr. Peter Attia. Peter, thanks joining today. - Thanks me, man. -
looking forward long time. - [Peter] I. - huge fan
podcast. know went Stanford worked number people
colleagues mine. me, already thrill, just this. -
Yeah, well, likewise. - ton questions, want start off something
wonder lot about, know many people wonder about,
assess current health trajectory terms health wellbeing,
specifically relates blood work. thoughts blood work?
necessary typical person? somebody not dealing
acute syndrome illness. age suggest people start getting blood
work? frequently get blood work? often get blood work
done, et cetera? - Yeah, lot there. mean, way talk patients
is, first, taking everything back objective. thing trying
optimize? person says, look, trying break 10 hours Ironman, don't
know blood work going game-changing aspect trajectory
training. know, going benefit much sort functional analyses
performance. assuming, based question, really coming
lens living longer living better lifespan health span
lens? - Mostly, yeah. think people sense vitality lack
vitality, think everyone wonders whether not feel better, whether
not blood work will give window might go feeling better. -
Yeah, think extent, also think lot blind spots.
kind break things two vectors make longevity, lifespan
health span. lifespan easiest vectors understand,
pretty binary. alive not alive. respiring not. make
ATP don't, end story. gets way lifespan essentially four
horsemen disease, right? atherosclerotic disease, cancer, neurodegenerative


disease, metabolic disease, directly isn't cause many deaths,
basically creates foundation diseases. So, know,
non-smoker, just rattled off 80% death. blood work
help address those? varies. atherosclerotic standpoint, good
predictor risk, know look for. primarily ApoB single
important lipoprotein care about. can explain means
second. also, markers inflammation, endothelial health, metabolic
health. comes cancer, know, blood testing sense biomarkers
not particularly helpful, outside knowing second leading environmental
modifiable cause cancer metabolic ill health, smoking. don't actually
know lot cancer sense causes it. really stochastic, lot
bad luck. know smoking drives it, know that, even though
epidemiologically say obesity drives it, really means metabolic poor health.
probably hyperinsulinemia comes obesity drives it. biomarkers
help that, still enormous blind spot cancer. talk
liquid biopsies aside, 'cause aren't really biomarker studies, put away.
neurodegenerative side, know, don't think lot insight comes
understanding Parkinson's disease, comes dementia, particularly
Alzheimer's disease, prevalent form dementia, think
biomarkers can quite helpful. overlap lot atherosclerotic diseases.
things drive risk heart disease driving risk dementia.
novel stuff well, include genetic testing, can get
blood test. get whole suite genes, not just APOE, far nuanced
stuff that, can also play role. can stratify risk sense.
aggregate, say, know,

00:11:51 Healthspan: Functional Testing, Cognitive & Emotional States

blood testing biomarkers provides pretty good insight lifespan. get
health span, kind cognitive, physical, emotional domains. think
biomarkers far less helpful, kind rely functional testing.
comes sort cognitive piece, know, can cognitive testing.
terms long-term risk, lot things imply good cognitive health age,
line things reduce risk dementia.


biomarkers look improve dementia risk reduction,
improving cognitive health. physical side, mean, outside
looking hormone levels things look extensively, understanding
might aid prevent metrics matter, really is,
biomarker aside thing. mean, much interested person's DEXA, CPET
testing, VO2 max testing, know, zone two lactate testing, fat oxidation.
consider functional tests give far insight that.
course emotional piece, depending are, might
single important piece, without none stuff matters, right?
totally miserable human being, relationships suck, don't think
stuff matters. certainly nothing looking biomarkers
giving great insight that. - ask emotional state, try
assess emotional state indirectly intake one patients? -
Probably not much intake, think takes form relationship
patient starts become something necessarily going
want talk about. definitely think important part do.
think without it, none stuff really matters. Again, irony thinking
many years spent sort pursuit fully optimizing every detail
everything, without attention paid dimension, not lost me.
look, patients who, just not something that, something
compartmentalized. Maybe they're, know,

00:13:59 Blood Testing: Best Frequency

well department, maybe aren't, just aren't willing
engage yet. - terms frequency blood testing, somebody feels pretty
good taking number steps, exercise, nutrition, et cetera, try extend
lifespan improve health span, year frequent enough, 20-
year-old start getting blood work done just get window going on?
Assuming can afford insurance can cover it. - Yeah, mean, look,
certainly think everybody screened early life look at, like,
single prevalent genetic driver atherosclerosis, Lp[a].
unfortunately physicians don't know Lp[a] is, yet somewhere
eight 12% population high enough, depending you,


know, recent guest podcast suggested high 20%,
high enough Lp[a], contributing atherosclerosis. not want
know that, genetically determined, right, something that, born
need really check once, wouldn't want know
20-year-old, can contribute lot early atherosclerosis see people.
leaving money table, opinion. frequency need test
really comes state interventions. don't think makes sense just
blood tests sake blood tests. kind reason.
something changing? know, blood test is, part, static intervention.
look window time. benefit
course year, unsure level. something comes back
doesn't look great, yeah, might make sense just recheck without reacting it.
typically, know, patients, might check blood two four times year,
also probably things now check, like hey, know, gave drug,
desired outcome? put three pounds muscle

00:16:01 DEXA Scan: Lean Mass & Fat, Bone Mineral Density & Osteoporosis

lost three pounds fat, desired outcome? - Speaking tracking
weight fat, lean mass percentages, something recommend
patients pretty often? know people step scale every day, know people
like frankly, might step scale three times year. don't really care.
pay attention things far subjective. Maybe making huge
mistake. thoughts quantitative measurements weight, BMI,
typical person? - think pretty crude. think DEXA, rather take DEXA
annually, maybe follow weight little bit closely get sense it.
DEXA getting, least way look data, four pieces
information. Now, people DEXA, explain is, I'm?
- Yeah, think people might not know DEXA is. fact, confess,
crude understanding is. Tell wrong, hopefully
least partially right. understanding number different ways
measure lean mass non-lean mass ratio, one put
underwater. one put sort non-underwater chamber.
calipering. looking mirror pinching changing


lighting. - know, funny, done enough, can, can sort tell
body fat abs, right. can sort tell by, know, good six pack
bad six pack is, leanness is. actually not terrible way
it. bodybuilder, example, never been, can tell difference
6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, just based degree visibility within abs.
basically, DEXA scan x-ray. principle just getting chest x-
ray, ionizing radiation passed body. plate behind
body collects comes through. denser medium electrons
trying go through, less collected. look x-
ray, everybody's probably seen x-ray, white dense.
had, know, piece metal pocket, show bright white thing.
ribs bones show white, things least dense, like
lungs, just air, blackest. everything shade gray
between. DEXA just effectively, moving x-ray. lay
bed takes maybe 10 minutes, little, low power x-ray kind
goes body. plate beneath collecting information basically
allowing differentiate three things, bone mineral content, fat, other.
quantified lean body mass. organs, muscles, everything else.
people DEXA, get report back, reports horrible.
yet see one company can way isn't abjectly horrible.
created templates, dashboard this, 'cause
just given trying use theirs. first thing people look
body fat. gold standard outside like MRI something,
used research purposes. DEXA going produce far better estimate
body fat, calipers buoyancy testing, things like that, provided machinery
well-calibrated, operator knows use it. heard people argue
hands like guy calipers whole life, probably
comparable calipers. nevertheless, off-the-shelf tech, DEXA amazing.
four things get spit DEXA, think body fat least
interesting. rank fourth list germane
health. three things get spit bone mineral density, visceral fat,
metrics allow compute, like basically compute called
appendicular lean mass index fat-free mass index. three metrics
significantly important body fat. reason follows, right? So, bone


mineral density basically speaks risk osteoporosis osteopenia.
doesn't sound sexy people age, know. 50-year-old guys listening this,
like, yeah, big deal. 50-year-old woman, huge deal, right? woman
just go menopause, just gone menopause,
enormous risk osteopenia, ultimately osteoporosis, estrogen
single important hormone regulating bone mineral density. can come
back talk case, interesting biomechanics
bones work, estrogen specifically important. huge cause
morbidity, right? So, know, age 65 fall break
hip, one year morbidity 30 40%. again, just put English,
65 older, fall break hip, 30 40% chance dead
year. - [Andrew] Wow. - Bones matter. want really get sense
stack age, sex. anywhere off pace,
ramp strategy super aggressive increase that,
minimum, prevent decay. - age-related charts sorts
things? - Yeah, gets spit called Z-score. looking
BMD, going give Z-score. Z-score zero means,
understand this, like, Z-score referring probability distribution standard
mode. Z-score zero means 50th percentile age sex. Z-
score plus one, one standard deviation above, minus one, below, et cetera.
also T-score, thing, comparing young
person. T-score technically used make diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis. tend look Z-score, basically say, look, Z-
score right now minus one, four years want Z-score zero. Not
necessarily increased entire way, maybe increased
slightly

00:22:33 Bone Mineral Density & Age-Related Decline, Strength Training,
Corticosteroids

expected would've declined. - see. things can
improve bone mineral density age? - turns real critical
window malleable. depending age someone's
listening us discuss this, know, 20, 25, still time


life able reach potential. turns strength training
probably single best thing can do. surprise me, 'cause we,
know, AMA topic little ago, got really deep
analysts. assumption running must best, like sort
impact must best thing can do. know, assumed running better
swimming cycling. turned power lifting probably best
thing do. think understand bones work, became
clear, is, know, power lifting really putting sheer force
muscle via tendon onto bone, bones really sensing.
sensing sheer force applied bone, compressive
way, depending bone course. basically activating
osteoblasts, cells allowing bone built. turns
probably important females, high can get period
development, say till 20 25, basically sets trajectory rest
life. get real trouble patients who, example, used large
amounts inhaled steroids period life, 'cause say really
bad asthma. patients needed large amounts corticosteroids
immune-related condition. critical window development,
taking drug impairing process. So, know, patients like
practice just enormous liability working really hard
overcome, nutrition, hormones, drugs, training. And, know,
just something aware of. - wasn't aware inhalants asthma
things sort can impair bone mineral density. - steroid-based.
course just beta-agonists, fine. - anything corticosteroid like?
- Yep. - Interesting. always get asked question, always reflexively
want say no, don't really know answer don't reply. topical
corticosteroid? know, people will put cortisone cream. me, seems almost
inconceivable systemic effect, again, know? -
dose time-related. So, know, talking like got little rash
skin, going put corticosteroids on, probably not. certainly,
enough put on, mean absorbed, issue. not typically
concerned with. mean, mostly concerned people taking
even modest amounts prednisone months, years time. Or, like said, kids
using steroid inhalers years years years. Again, not suggesting


kid's steroid inhaler shouldn't be. solve important
problem, asthma important problem, it. think just want
turn into, okay, well, much imperative kid things
putting high amount stress bones, via muscles, make sure
maximal capacity build. - think somebody 30s 40s
50s still benefit strength training terms bone mineral density
longevity, relates bone mineral density, given key window earlier,
might missed one. - Oh yeah, no, no, essential rest life
now trying prevent fall off. basically way works
sort of, birth say 20 growth. 20 50, plateau. 50, men
start decline, really small. Women start decline precipitous. -
related drop estrogen associated menopause premenopause? - [Peter]
Correct. - can get broad contours strength training
looks like? Dr. Andy Galpin show, talked lot ways build
strength versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera. think pretty good
agreement across fields physiotherapy, et cetera, physiology medicine,
terms that. understanding fairly low repetition ranges,
anywhere one six repetitions. Typically not aiming pump hypertrophy,
sort thing. heavy loads hard move, 80% one repetition maximum
more, done long rest periods, two three times week type thing,
right? - Yeah, look literature this, going tell you, going
differentiate power lifting weightlifting. words, yeah, need kind
moving heavy load. Now again, can look different depending
level experience. Like really like deadlifting. Now, mean, can count
number days left life going want sets 400 pounds. But,
know, pick choose days do. But, know, grew
things, comfortable movements. 60-year-old woman never
lifted weights life, now get lifting, mean, get
deadlift, think, wouldn't make perfect enemy good. happy put
leg press machine just get that. know, not pure
movement deadlift, cares, right? can still put heavy load,
her, safely. So, now said, mean, study done
Australia, I'm, know, hopefully can find link it. video
YouTube actually kind PI sort walking results. send


you. - [Andrew] Okay, yeah track down. - just amazing. took
group older women. looked like 60s 70s, never
lifted weights life, osteopenia, probably already
osteoporosis, basically just put strength training protocol.
remarkable watch women. good mornings. dead
lifts. picking heavy things off ground. think one woman picking up,
God, want say like picking like 50, 60 kilos off ground. mean, just
staggering sums weight women never done anything.
bone health improving age. goal, frankly, just, know, never get
point first time. Strength training
essential part existence

00:29:24 Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training

never late start, never stop. - love advice.
systemic effect local effect? So, instance, say that, well, mother's
late 70s. actually used really strong kids. move
fish tank room long move it, always, really
strong. years, wouldn't call frail means, certainly think
benefit strength training. say start leg
presses start even air squats maybe work pushups,
effects local, meaning just train legs just pushups,
loads applied limbs muscles tissues involved? -
think bulk is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Andrew] need train
whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep mind, diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis based three locations, left hip, right hip, lumbar
spine. So, know, just convention make diagnosis.
think part majority insults occur. Now not
insults, seen people have, know, horrible bone density,
fracturing ankles tibia, fibula, like low tib fib fractures just
walking. clearly bone density outside regions matter. much
really focused on, and, way, know, fall, break wrist,
systemic issue. majority response local response, 'cause really
comes putting load



00:31:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

directly bone, bone, kind, respond laying
bone. - continue today's discussion, like just briefly acknowledge

00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining “Marginal Decade”

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

disease, metabolic disease, directly isn't cause many deaths,
basically creates foundation diseases. So, know,
non-smoker, just rattled off 80% death. blood work
help address those? varies. atherosclerotic standpoint, good
predictor risk, know look for. primarily ApoB single
important lipoprotein care about. can explain means
second. also, markers inflammation, endothelial health, metabolic
health. comes cancer, know, blood testing sense biomarkers
not particularly helpful, outside knowing second leading environmental
modifiable cause cancer metabolic ill health, smoking. don't actually
know lot cancer sense causes it. really stochastic, lot
bad luck. know smoking drives it, know that, even though
epidemiologically say obesity drives it, really means metabolic poor health.
probably hyperinsulinemia comes obesity drives it. biomarkers
help that, still enormous blind spot cancer. talk
liquid biopsies aside, 'cause aren't really biomarker studies, put away.
neurodegenerative side, know, don't think lot insight comes
understanding Parkinson's disease, comes dementia, particularly
Alzheimer's disease, prevalent form dementia, think
biomarkers can quite helpful. overlap lot atherosclerotic diseases.
things drive risk heart disease driving risk dementia.
novel stuff well, include genetic testing, can get
blood test. get whole suite genes, not just APOE, far nuanced
stuff that, can also play role. can stratify risk sense.
aggregate, say, know,

00:11:51 Healthspan: Functional Testing, Cognitive & Emotional States

blood testing biomarkers provides pretty good insight lifespan. get
health span, kind cognitive, physical, emotional domains. think
biomarkers far less helpful, kind rely functional testing.
comes sort cognitive piece, know, can cognitive testing.
terms long-term risk, lot things imply good cognitive health age,
line things reduce risk dementia.


biomarkers look improve dementia risk reduction,
improving cognitive health. physical side, mean, outside
looking hormone levels things look extensively, understanding
might aid prevent metrics matter, really is,
biomarker aside thing. mean, much interested person's DEXA, CPET
testing, VO2 max testing, know, zone two lactate testing, fat oxidation.
consider functional tests give far insight that.
course emotional piece, depending are, might
single important piece, without none stuff matters, right?
totally miserable human being, relationships suck, don't think
stuff matters. certainly nothing looking biomarkers
giving great insight that. - ask emotional state, try
assess emotional state indirectly intake one patients? -
Probably not much intake, think takes form relationship
patient starts become something necessarily going
want talk about. definitely think important part do.
think without it, none stuff really matters. Again, irony thinking
many years spent sort pursuit fully optimizing every detail
everything, without attention paid dimension, not lost me.
look, patients who, just not something that, something
compartmentalized. Maybe they're, know,

00:13:59 Blood Testing: Best Frequency

well department, maybe aren't, just aren't willing
engage yet. - terms frequency blood testing, somebody feels pretty
good taking number steps, exercise, nutrition, et cetera, try extend
lifespan improve health span, year frequent enough, 20-
year-old start getting blood work done just get window going on?
Assuming can afford insurance can cover it. - Yeah, mean, look,
certainly think everybody screened early life look at, like,
single prevalent genetic driver atherosclerosis, Lp[a].
unfortunately physicians don't know Lp[a] is, yet somewhere
eight 12% population high enough, depending you,


know, recent guest podcast suggested high 20%,
high enough Lp[a], contributing atherosclerosis. not want
know that, genetically determined, right, something that, born
need really check once, wouldn't want know
20-year-old, can contribute lot early atherosclerosis see people.
leaving money table, opinion. frequency need test
really comes state interventions. don't think makes sense just
blood tests sake blood tests. kind reason.
something changing? know, blood test is, part, static intervention.
look window time. benefit
course year, unsure level. something comes back
doesn't look great, yeah, might make sense just recheck without reacting it.
typically, know, patients, might check blood two four times year,
also probably things now check, like hey, know, gave drug,
desired outcome? put three pounds muscle

00:16:01 DEXA Scan: Lean Mass & Fat, Bone Mineral Density & Osteoporosis

lost three pounds fat, desired outcome? - Speaking tracking
weight fat, lean mass percentages, something recommend
patients pretty often? know people step scale every day, know people
like frankly, might step scale three times year. don't really care.
pay attention things far subjective. Maybe making huge
mistake. thoughts quantitative measurements weight, BMI,
typical person? - think pretty crude. think DEXA, rather take DEXA
annually, maybe follow weight little bit closely get sense it.
DEXA getting, least way look data, four pieces
information. Now, people DEXA, explain is, I'm?
- Yeah, think people might not know DEXA is. fact, confess,
crude understanding is. Tell wrong, hopefully
least partially right. understanding number different ways
measure lean mass non-lean mass ratio, one put
underwater. one put sort non-underwater chamber.
calipering. looking mirror pinching changing


lighting. - know, funny, done enough, can, can sort tell
body fat abs, right. can sort tell by, know, good six pack
bad six pack is, leanness is. actually not terrible way
it. bodybuilder, example, never been, can tell difference
6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, just based degree visibility within abs.
basically, DEXA scan x-ray. principle just getting chest x-
ray, ionizing radiation passed body. plate behind
body collects comes through. denser medium electrons
trying go through, less collected. look x-
ray, everybody's probably seen x-ray, white dense.
had, know, piece metal pocket, show bright white thing.
ribs bones show white, things least dense, like
lungs, just air, blackest. everything shade gray
between. DEXA just effectively, moving x-ray. lay
bed takes maybe 10 minutes, little, low power x-ray kind
goes body. plate beneath collecting information basically
allowing differentiate three things, bone mineral content, fat, other.
quantified lean body mass. organs, muscles, everything else.
people DEXA, get report back, reports horrible.
yet see one company can way isn't abjectly horrible.
created templates, dashboard this, 'cause
just given trying use theirs. first thing people look
body fat. gold standard outside like MRI something,
used research purposes. DEXA going produce far better estimate
body fat, calipers buoyancy testing, things like that, provided machinery
well-calibrated, operator knows use it. heard people argue
hands like guy calipers whole life, probably
comparable calipers. nevertheless, off-the-shelf tech, DEXA amazing.
four things get spit DEXA, think body fat least
interesting. rank fourth list germane
health. three things get spit bone mineral density, visceral fat,
metrics allow compute, like basically compute called
appendicular lean mass index fat-free mass index. three metrics
significantly important body fat. reason follows, right? So, bone


mineral density basically speaks risk osteoporosis osteopenia.
doesn't sound sexy people age, know. 50-year-old guys listening this,
like, yeah, big deal. 50-year-old woman, huge deal, right? woman
just go menopause, just gone menopause,
enormous risk osteopenia, ultimately osteoporosis, estrogen
single important hormone regulating bone mineral density. can come
back talk case, interesting biomechanics
bones work, estrogen specifically important. huge cause
morbidity, right? So, know, age 65 fall break
hip, one year morbidity 30 40%. again, just put English,
65 older, fall break hip, 30 40% chance dead
year. - [Andrew] Wow. - Bones matter. want really get sense
stack age, sex. anywhere off pace,
ramp strategy super aggressive increase that,
minimum, prevent decay. - age-related charts sorts
things? - Yeah, gets spit called Z-score. looking
BMD, going give Z-score. Z-score zero means,
understand this, like, Z-score referring probability distribution standard
mode. Z-score zero means 50th percentile age sex. Z-
score plus one, one standard deviation above, minus one, below, et cetera.
also T-score, thing, comparing young
person. T-score technically used make diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis. tend look Z-score, basically say, look, Z-
score right now minus one, four years want Z-score zero. Not
necessarily increased entire way, maybe increased
slightly

00:22:33 Bone Mineral Density & Age-Related Decline, Strength Training,
Corticosteroids

expected would've declined. - see. things can
improve bone mineral density age? - turns real critical
window malleable. depending age someone's
listening us discuss this, know, 20, 25, still time


life able reach potential. turns strength training
probably single best thing can do. surprise me, 'cause we,
know, AMA topic little ago, got really deep
analysts. assumption running must best, like sort
impact must best thing can do. know, assumed running better
swimming cycling. turned power lifting probably best
thing do. think understand bones work, became
clear, is, know, power lifting really putting sheer force
muscle via tendon onto bone, bones really sensing.
sensing sheer force applied bone, compressive
way, depending bone course. basically activating
osteoblasts, cells allowing bone built. turns
probably important females, high can get period
development, say till 20 25, basically sets trajectory rest
life. get real trouble patients who, example, used large
amounts inhaled steroids period life, 'cause say really
bad asthma. patients needed large amounts corticosteroids
immune-related condition. critical window development,
taking drug impairing process. So, know, patients like
practice just enormous liability working really hard
overcome, nutrition, hormones, drugs, training. And, know,
just something aware of. - wasn't aware inhalants asthma
things sort can impair bone mineral density. - steroid-based.
course just beta-agonists, fine. - anything corticosteroid like?
- Yep. - Interesting. always get asked question, always reflexively
want say no, don't really know answer don't reply. topical
corticosteroid? know, people will put cortisone cream. me, seems almost
inconceivable systemic effect, again, know? -
dose time-related. So, know, talking like got little rash
skin, going put corticosteroids on, probably not. certainly,
enough put on, mean absorbed, issue. not typically
concerned with. mean, mostly concerned people taking
even modest amounts prednisone months, years time. Or, like said, kids
using steroid inhalers years years years. Again, not suggesting


kid's steroid inhaler shouldn't be. solve important
problem, asthma important problem, it. think just want
turn into, okay, well, much imperative kid things
putting high amount stress bones, via muscles, make sure
maximal capacity build. - think somebody 30s 40s
50s still benefit strength training terms bone mineral density
longevity, relates bone mineral density, given key window earlier,
might missed one. - Oh yeah, no, no, essential rest life
now trying prevent fall off. basically way works
sort of, birth say 20 growth. 20 50, plateau. 50, men
start decline, really small. Women start decline precipitous. -
related drop estrogen associated menopause premenopause? - [Peter]
Correct. - can get broad contours strength training
looks like? Dr. Andy Galpin show, talked lot ways build
strength versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera. think pretty good
agreement across fields physiotherapy, et cetera, physiology medicine,
terms that. understanding fairly low repetition ranges,
anywhere one six repetitions. Typically not aiming pump hypertrophy,
sort thing. heavy loads hard move, 80% one repetition maximum
more, done long rest periods, two three times week type thing,
right? - Yeah, look literature this, going tell you, going
differentiate power lifting weightlifting. words, yeah, need kind
moving heavy load. Now again, can look different depending
level experience. Like really like deadlifting. Now, mean, can count
number days left life going want sets 400 pounds. But,
know, pick choose days do. But, know, grew
things, comfortable movements. 60-year-old woman never
lifted weights life, now get lifting, mean, get
deadlift, think, wouldn't make perfect enemy good. happy put
leg press machine just get that. know, not pure
movement deadlift, cares, right? can still put heavy load,
her, safely. So, now said, mean, study done
Australia, I'm, know, hopefully can find link it. video
YouTube actually kind PI sort walking results. send


you. - [Andrew] Okay, yeah track down. - just amazing. took
group older women. looked like 60s 70s, never
lifted weights life, osteopenia, probably already
osteoporosis, basically just put strength training protocol.
remarkable watch women. good mornings. dead
lifts. picking heavy things off ground. think one woman picking up,
God, want say like picking like 50, 60 kilos off ground. mean, just
staggering sums weight women never done anything.
bone health improving age. goal, frankly, just, know, never get
point first time. Strength training
essential part existence

00:29:24 Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training

never late start, never stop. - love advice.
systemic effect local effect? So, instance, say that, well, mother's
late 70s. actually used really strong kids. move
fish tank room long move it, always, really
strong. years, wouldn't call frail means, certainly think
benefit strength training. say start leg
presses start even air squats maybe work pushups,
effects local, meaning just train legs just pushups,
loads applied limbs muscles tissues involved? -
think bulk is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Andrew] need train
whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep mind, diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis based three locations, left hip, right hip, lumbar
spine. So, know, just convention make diagnosis.
think part majority insults occur. Now not
insults, seen people have, know, horrible bone density,
fracturing ankles tibia, fibula, like low tib fib fractures just
walking. clearly bone density outside regions matter. much
really focused on, and, way, know, fall, break wrist,
systemic issue. majority response local response, 'cause really
comes putting load



00:31:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining “Marginal Decade”

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

biomarkers look improve dementia risk reduction,
improving cognitive health. physical side, mean, outside
looking hormone levels things look extensively, understanding
might aid prevent metrics matter, really is,
biomarker aside thing. mean, much interested person's DEXA, CPET
testing, VO2 max testing, know, zone two lactate testing, fat oxidation.
consider functional tests give far insight that.
course emotional piece, depending are, might
single important piece, without none stuff matters, right?
totally miserable human being, relationships suck, don't think
stuff matters. certainly nothing looking biomarkers
giving great insight that. - ask emotional state, try
assess emotional state indirectly intake one patients? -
Probably not much intake, think takes form relationship
patient starts become something necessarily going
want talk about. definitely think important part do.
think without it, none stuff really matters. Again, irony thinking
many years spent sort pursuit fully optimizing every detail
everything, without attention paid dimension, not lost me.
look, patients who, just not something that, something
compartmentalized. Maybe they're, know,

00:13:59 Blood Testing: Best Frequency

well department, maybe aren't, just aren't willing
engage yet. - terms frequency blood testing, somebody feels pretty
good taking number steps, exercise, nutrition, et cetera, try extend
lifespan improve health span, year frequent enough, 20-
year-old start getting blood work done just get window going on?
Assuming can afford insurance can cover it. - Yeah, mean, look,
certainly think everybody screened early life look at, like,
single prevalent genetic driver atherosclerosis, Lp[a].
unfortunately physicians don't know Lp[a] is, yet somewhere
eight 12% population high enough, depending you,


know, recent guest podcast suggested high 20%,
high enough Lp[a], contributing atherosclerosis. not want
know that, genetically determined, right, something that, born
need really check once, wouldn't want know
20-year-old, can contribute lot early atherosclerosis see people.
leaving money table, opinion. frequency need test
really comes state interventions. don't think makes sense just
blood tests sake blood tests. kind reason.
something changing? know, blood test is, part, static intervention.
look window time. benefit
course year, unsure level. something comes back
doesn't look great, yeah, might make sense just recheck without reacting it.
typically, know, patients, might check blood two four times year,
also probably things now check, like hey, know, gave drug,
desired outcome? put three pounds muscle

00:16:01 DEXA Scan: Lean Mass & Fat, Bone Mineral Density & Osteoporosis

lost three pounds fat, desired outcome? - Speaking tracking
weight fat, lean mass percentages, something recommend
patients pretty often? know people step scale every day, know people
like frankly, might step scale three times year. don't really care.
pay attention things far subjective. Maybe making huge
mistake. thoughts quantitative measurements weight, BMI,
typical person? - think pretty crude. think DEXA, rather take DEXA
annually, maybe follow weight little bit closely get sense it.
DEXA getting, least way look data, four pieces
information. Now, people DEXA, explain is, I'm?
- Yeah, think people might not know DEXA is. fact, confess,
crude understanding is. Tell wrong, hopefully
least partially right. understanding number different ways
measure lean mass non-lean mass ratio, one put
underwater. one put sort non-underwater chamber.
calipering. looking mirror pinching changing


lighting. - know, funny, done enough, can, can sort tell
body fat abs, right. can sort tell by, know, good six pack
bad six pack is, leanness is. actually not terrible way
it. bodybuilder, example, never been, can tell difference
6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, just based degree visibility within abs.
basically, DEXA scan x-ray. principle just getting chest x-
ray, ionizing radiation passed body. plate behind
body collects comes through. denser medium electrons
trying go through, less collected. look x-
ray, everybody's probably seen x-ray, white dense.
had, know, piece metal pocket, show bright white thing.
ribs bones show white, things least dense, like
lungs, just air, blackest. everything shade gray
between. DEXA just effectively, moving x-ray. lay
bed takes maybe 10 minutes, little, low power x-ray kind
goes body. plate beneath collecting information basically
allowing differentiate three things, bone mineral content, fat, other.
quantified lean body mass. organs, muscles, everything else.
people DEXA, get report back, reports horrible.
yet see one company can way isn't abjectly horrible.
created templates, dashboard this, 'cause
just given trying use theirs. first thing people look
body fat. gold standard outside like MRI something,
used research purposes. DEXA going produce far better estimate
body fat, calipers buoyancy testing, things like that, provided machinery
well-calibrated, operator knows use it. heard people argue
hands like guy calipers whole life, probably
comparable calipers. nevertheless, off-the-shelf tech, DEXA amazing.
four things get spit DEXA, think body fat least
interesting. rank fourth list germane
health. three things get spit bone mineral density, visceral fat,
metrics allow compute, like basically compute called
appendicular lean mass index fat-free mass index. three metrics
significantly important body fat. reason follows, right? So, bone


mineral density basically speaks risk osteoporosis osteopenia.
doesn't sound sexy people age, know. 50-year-old guys listening this,
like, yeah, big deal. 50-year-old woman, huge deal, right? woman
just go menopause, just gone menopause,
enormous risk osteopenia, ultimately osteoporosis, estrogen
single important hormone regulating bone mineral density. can come
back talk case, interesting biomechanics
bones work, estrogen specifically important. huge cause
morbidity, right? So, know, age 65 fall break
hip, one year morbidity 30 40%. again, just put English,
65 older, fall break hip, 30 40% chance dead
year. - [Andrew] Wow. - Bones matter. want really get sense
stack age, sex. anywhere off pace,
ramp strategy super aggressive increase that,
minimum, prevent decay. - age-related charts sorts
things? - Yeah, gets spit called Z-score. looking
BMD, going give Z-score. Z-score zero means,
understand this, like, Z-score referring probability distribution standard
mode. Z-score zero means 50th percentile age sex. Z-
score plus one, one standard deviation above, minus one, below, et cetera.
also T-score, thing, comparing young
person. T-score technically used make diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis. tend look Z-score, basically say, look, Z-
score right now minus one, four years want Z-score zero. Not
necessarily increased entire way, maybe increased
slightly

00:22:33 Bone Mineral Density & Age-Related Decline, Strength Training,
Corticosteroids

expected would've declined. - see. things can
improve bone mineral density age? - turns real critical
window malleable. depending age someone's
listening us discuss this, know, 20, 25, still time


life able reach potential. turns strength training
probably single best thing can do. surprise me, 'cause we,
know, AMA topic little ago, got really deep
analysts. assumption running must best, like sort
impact must best thing can do. know, assumed running better
swimming cycling. turned power lifting probably best
thing do. think understand bones work, became
clear, is, know, power lifting really putting sheer force
muscle via tendon onto bone, bones really sensing.
sensing sheer force applied bone, compressive
way, depending bone course. basically activating
osteoblasts, cells allowing bone built. turns
probably important females, high can get period
development, say till 20 25, basically sets trajectory rest
life. get real trouble patients who, example, used large
amounts inhaled steroids period life, 'cause say really
bad asthma. patients needed large amounts corticosteroids
immune-related condition. critical window development,
taking drug impairing process. So, know, patients like
practice just enormous liability working really hard
overcome, nutrition, hormones, drugs, training. And, know,
just something aware of. - wasn't aware inhalants asthma
things sort can impair bone mineral density. - steroid-based.
course just beta-agonists, fine. - anything corticosteroid like?
- Yep. - Interesting. always get asked question, always reflexively
want say no, don't really know answer don't reply. topical
corticosteroid? know, people will put cortisone cream. me, seems almost
inconceivable systemic effect, again, know? -
dose time-related. So, know, talking like got little rash
skin, going put corticosteroids on, probably not. certainly,
enough put on, mean absorbed, issue. not typically
concerned with. mean, mostly concerned people taking
even modest amounts prednisone months, years time. Or, like said, kids
using steroid inhalers years years years. Again, not suggesting


kid's steroid inhaler shouldn't be. solve important
problem, asthma important problem, it. think just want
turn into, okay, well, much imperative kid things
putting high amount stress bones, via muscles, make sure
maximal capacity build. - think somebody 30s 40s
50s still benefit strength training terms bone mineral density
longevity, relates bone mineral density, given key window earlier,
might missed one. - Oh yeah, no, no, essential rest life
now trying prevent fall off. basically way works
sort of, birth say 20 growth. 20 50, plateau. 50, men
start decline, really small. Women start decline precipitous. -
related drop estrogen associated menopause premenopause? - [Peter]
Correct. - can get broad contours strength training
looks like? Dr. Andy Galpin show, talked lot ways build
strength versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera. think pretty good
agreement across fields physiotherapy, et cetera, physiology medicine,
terms that. understanding fairly low repetition ranges,
anywhere one six repetitions. Typically not aiming pump hypertrophy,
sort thing. heavy loads hard move, 80% one repetition maximum
more, done long rest periods, two three times week type thing,
right? - Yeah, look literature this, going tell you, going
differentiate power lifting weightlifting. words, yeah, need kind
moving heavy load. Now again, can look different depending
level experience. Like really like deadlifting. Now, mean, can count
number days left life going want sets 400 pounds. But,
know, pick choose days do. But, know, grew
things, comfortable movements. 60-year-old woman never
lifted weights life, now get lifting, mean, get
deadlift, think, wouldn't make perfect enemy good. happy put
leg press machine just get that. know, not pure
movement deadlift, cares, right? can still put heavy load,
her, safely. So, now said, mean, study done
Australia, I'm, know, hopefully can find link it. video
YouTube actually kind PI sort walking results. send


you. - [Andrew] Okay, yeah track down. - just amazing. took
group older women. looked like 60s 70s, never
lifted weights life, osteopenia, probably already
osteoporosis, basically just put strength training protocol.
remarkable watch women. good mornings. dead
lifts. picking heavy things off ground. think one woman picking up,
God, want say like picking like 50, 60 kilos off ground. mean, just
staggering sums weight women never done anything.
bone health improving age. goal, frankly, just, know, never get
point first time. Strength training
essential part existence

00:29:24 Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training

never late start, never stop. - love advice.
systemic effect local effect? So, instance, say that, well, mother's
late 70s. actually used really strong kids. move
fish tank room long move it, always, really
strong. years, wouldn't call frail means, certainly think
benefit strength training. say start leg
presses start even air squats maybe work pushups,
effects local, meaning just train legs just pushups,
loads applied limbs muscles tissues involved? -
think bulk is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Andrew] need train
whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep mind, diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis based three locations, left hip, right hip, lumbar
spine. So, know, just convention make diagnosis.
think part majority insults occur. Now not
insults, seen people have, know, horrible bone density,
fracturing ankles tibia, fibula, like low tib fib fractures just
walking. clearly bone density outside regions matter. much
really focused on, and, way, know, fall, break wrist,
systemic issue. majority response local response, 'cause really
comes putting load



00:31:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

directly bone, bone, kind, respond laying
bone. - continue today's discussion, like just briefly acknowledge
sponsor Athletic Greens, now called AG1. Athletic Greens, aka AG1, all-in-one

00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining “Marginal Decade”

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

know, recent guest podcast suggested high 20%,
high enough Lp[a], contributing atherosclerosis. not want
know that, genetically determined, right, something that, born
need really check once, wouldn't want know
20-year-old, can contribute lot early atherosclerosis see people.
leaving money table, opinion. frequency need test
really comes state interventions. don't think makes sense just
blood tests sake blood tests. kind reason.
something changing? know, blood test is, part, static intervention.
look window time. benefit
course year, unsure level. something comes back
doesn't look great, yeah, might make sense just recheck without reacting it.
typically, know, patients, might check blood two four times year,
also probably things now check, like hey, know, gave drug,
desired outcome? put three pounds muscle

00:16:01 DEXA Scan: Lean Mass & Fat, Bone Mineral Density & Osteoporosis

lost three pounds fat, desired outcome? - Speaking tracking
weight fat, lean mass percentages, something recommend
patients pretty often? know people step scale every day, know people
like frankly, might step scale three times year. don't really care.
pay attention things far subjective. Maybe making huge
mistake. thoughts quantitative measurements weight, BMI,
typical person? - think pretty crude. think DEXA, rather take DEXA
annually, maybe follow weight little bit closely get sense it.
DEXA getting, least way look data, four pieces
information. Now, people DEXA, explain is, I'm?
- Yeah, think people might not know DEXA is. fact, confess,
crude understanding is. Tell wrong, hopefully
least partially right. understanding number different ways
measure lean mass non-lean mass ratio, one put
underwater. one put sort non-underwater chamber.
calipering. looking mirror pinching changing


lighting. - know, funny, done enough, can, can sort tell
body fat abs, right. can sort tell by, know, good six pack
bad six pack is, leanness is. actually not terrible way
it. bodybuilder, example, never been, can tell difference
6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, just based degree visibility within abs.
basically, DEXA scan x-ray. principle just getting chest x-
ray, ionizing radiation passed body. plate behind
body collects comes through. denser medium electrons
trying go through, less collected. look x-
ray, everybody's probably seen x-ray, white dense.
had, know, piece metal pocket, show bright white thing.
ribs bones show white, things least dense, like
lungs, just air, blackest. everything shade gray
between. DEXA just effectively, moving x-ray. lay
bed takes maybe 10 minutes, little, low power x-ray kind
goes body. plate beneath collecting information basically
allowing differentiate three things, bone mineral content, fat, other.
quantified lean body mass. organs, muscles, everything else.
people DEXA, get report back, reports horrible.
yet see one company can way isn't abjectly horrible.
created templates, dashboard this, 'cause
just given trying use theirs. first thing people look
body fat. gold standard outside like MRI something,
used research purposes. DEXA going produce far better estimate
body fat, calipers buoyancy testing, things like that, provided machinery
well-calibrated, operator knows use it. heard people argue
hands like guy calipers whole life, probably
comparable calipers. nevertheless, off-the-shelf tech, DEXA amazing.
four things get spit DEXA, think body fat least
interesting. rank fourth list germane
health. three things get spit bone mineral density, visceral fat,
metrics allow compute, like basically compute called
appendicular lean mass index fat-free mass index. three metrics
significantly important body fat. reason follows, right? So, bone


mineral density basically speaks risk osteoporosis osteopenia.
doesn't sound sexy people age, know. 50-year-old guys listening this,
like, yeah, big deal. 50-year-old woman, huge deal, right? woman
just go menopause, just gone menopause,
enormous risk osteopenia, ultimately osteoporosis, estrogen
single important hormone regulating bone mineral density. can come
back talk case, interesting biomechanics
bones work, estrogen specifically important. huge cause
morbidity, right? So, know, age 65 fall break
hip, one year morbidity 30 40%. again, just put English,
65 older, fall break hip, 30 40% chance dead
year. - [Andrew] Wow. - Bones matter. want really get sense
stack age, sex. anywhere off pace,
ramp strategy super aggressive increase that,
minimum, prevent decay. - age-related charts sorts
things? - Yeah, gets spit called Z-score. looking
BMD, going give Z-score. Z-score zero means,
understand this, like, Z-score referring probability distribution standard
mode. Z-score zero means 50th percentile age sex. Z-
score plus one, one standard deviation above, minus one, below, et cetera.
also T-score, thing, comparing young
person. T-score technically used make diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis. tend look Z-score, basically say, look, Z-
score right now minus one, four years want Z-score zero. Not
necessarily increased entire way, maybe increased
slightly

00:22:33 Bone Mineral Density & Age-Related Decline, Strength Training,
Corticosteroids

expected would've declined. - see. things can
improve bone mineral density age? - turns real critical
window malleable. depending age someone's
listening us discuss this, know, 20, 25, still time


life able reach potential. turns strength training
probably single best thing can do. surprise me, 'cause we,
know, AMA topic little ago, got really deep
analysts. assumption running must best, like sort
impact must best thing can do. know, assumed running better
swimming cycling. turned power lifting probably best
thing do. think understand bones work, became
clear, is, know, power lifting really putting sheer force
muscle via tendon onto bone, bones really sensing.
sensing sheer force applied bone, compressive
way, depending bone course. basically activating
osteoblasts, cells allowing bone built. turns
probably important females, high can get period
development, say till 20 25, basically sets trajectory rest
life. get real trouble patients who, example, used large
amounts inhaled steroids period life, 'cause say really
bad asthma. patients needed large amounts corticosteroids
immune-related condition. critical window development,
taking drug impairing process. So, know, patients like
practice just enormous liability working really hard
overcome, nutrition, hormones, drugs, training. And, know,
just something aware of. - wasn't aware inhalants asthma
things sort can impair bone mineral density. - steroid-based.
course just beta-agonists, fine. - anything corticosteroid like?
- Yep. - Interesting. always get asked question, always reflexively
want say no, don't really know answer don't reply. topical
corticosteroid? know, people will put cortisone cream. me, seems almost
inconceivable systemic effect, again, know? -
dose time-related. So, know, talking like got little rash
skin, going put corticosteroids on, probably not. certainly,
enough put on, mean absorbed, issue. not typically
concerned with. mean, mostly concerned people taking
even modest amounts prednisone months, years time. Or, like said, kids
using steroid inhalers years years years. Again, not suggesting


kid's steroid inhaler shouldn't be. solve important
problem, asthma important problem, it. think just want
turn into, okay, well, much imperative kid things
putting high amount stress bones, via muscles, make sure
maximal capacity build. - think somebody 30s 40s
50s still benefit strength training terms bone mineral density
longevity, relates bone mineral density, given key window earlier,
might missed one. - Oh yeah, no, no, essential rest life
now trying prevent fall off. basically way works
sort of, birth say 20 growth. 20 50, plateau. 50, men
start decline, really small. Women start decline precipitous. -
related drop estrogen associated menopause premenopause? - [Peter]
Correct. - can get broad contours strength training
looks like? Dr. Andy Galpin show, talked lot ways build
strength versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera. think pretty good
agreement across fields physiotherapy, et cetera, physiology medicine,
terms that. understanding fairly low repetition ranges,
anywhere one six repetitions. Typically not aiming pump hypertrophy,
sort thing. heavy loads hard move, 80% one repetition maximum
more, done long rest periods, two three times week type thing,
right? - Yeah, look literature this, going tell you, going
differentiate power lifting weightlifting. words, yeah, need kind
moving heavy load. Now again, can look different depending
level experience. Like really like deadlifting. Now, mean, can count
number days left life going want sets 400 pounds. But,
know, pick choose days do. But, know, grew
things, comfortable movements. 60-year-old woman never
lifted weights life, now get lifting, mean, get
deadlift, think, wouldn't make perfect enemy good. happy put
leg press machine just get that. know, not pure
movement deadlift, cares, right? can still put heavy load,
her, safely. So, now said, mean, study done
Australia, I'm, know, hopefully can find link it. video
YouTube actually kind PI sort walking results. send


you. - [Andrew] Okay, yeah track down. - just amazing. took
group older women. looked like 60s 70s, never
lifted weights life, osteopenia, probably already
osteoporosis, basically just put strength training protocol.
remarkable watch women. good mornings. dead
lifts. picking heavy things off ground. think one woman picking up,
God, want say like picking like 50, 60 kilos off ground. mean, just
staggering sums weight women never done anything.
bone health improving age. goal, frankly, just, know, never get
point first time. Strength training
essential part existence

00:29:24 Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training

never late start, never stop. - love advice.
systemic effect local effect? So, instance, say that, well, mother's
late 70s. actually used really strong kids. move
fish tank room long move it, always, really
strong. years, wouldn't call frail means, certainly think
benefit strength training. say start leg
presses start even air squats maybe work pushups,
effects local, meaning just train legs just pushups,
loads applied limbs muscles tissues involved? -
think bulk is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Andrew] need train
whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep mind, diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis based three locations, left hip, right hip, lumbar
spine. So, know, just convention make diagnosis.
think part majority insults occur. Now not
insults, seen people have, know, horrible bone density,
fracturing ankles tibia, fibula, like low tib fib fractures just
walking. clearly bone density outside regions matter. much
really focused on, and, way, know, fall, break wrist,
systemic issue. majority response local response, 'cause really
comes putting load



00:31:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

directly bone, bone, kind, respond laying
bone. - continue today's discussion, like just briefly acknowledge
sponsor Athletic Greens, now called AG1. Athletic Greens, aka AG1, all-in-one

00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining “Marginal Decade”

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

lighting. - know, funny, done enough, can, can sort tell
body fat abs, right. can sort tell by, know, good six pack
bad six pack is, leanness is. actually not terrible way
it. bodybuilder, example, never been, can tell difference
6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, just based degree visibility within abs.
basically, DEXA scan x-ray. principle just getting chest x-
ray, ionizing radiation passed body. plate behind
body collects comes through. denser medium electrons
trying go through, less collected. look x-
ray, everybody's probably seen x-ray, white dense.
had, know, piece metal pocket, show bright white thing.
ribs bones show white, things least dense, like
lungs, just air, blackest. everything shade gray
between. DEXA just effectively, moving x-ray. lay
bed takes maybe 10 minutes, little, low power x-ray kind
goes body. plate beneath collecting information basically
allowing differentiate three things, bone mineral content, fat, other.
quantified lean body mass. organs, muscles, everything else.
people DEXA, get report back, reports horrible.
yet see one company can way isn't abjectly horrible.
created templates, dashboard this, 'cause
just given trying use theirs. first thing people look
body fat. gold standard outside like MRI something,
used research purposes. DEXA going produce far better estimate
body fat, calipers buoyancy testing, things like that, provided machinery
well-calibrated, operator knows use it. heard people argue
hands like guy calipers whole life, probably
comparable calipers. nevertheless, off-the-shelf tech, DEXA amazing.
four things get spit DEXA, think body fat least
interesting. rank fourth list germane
health. three things get spit bone mineral density, visceral fat,
metrics allow compute, like basically compute called
appendicular lean mass index fat-free mass index. three metrics
significantly important body fat. reason follows, right? So, bone


mineral density basically speaks risk osteoporosis osteopenia.
doesn't sound sexy people age, know. 50-year-old guys listening this,
like, yeah, big deal. 50-year-old woman, huge deal, right? woman
just go menopause, just gone menopause,
enormous risk osteopenia, ultimately osteoporosis, estrogen
single important hormone regulating bone mineral density. can come
back talk case, interesting biomechanics
bones work, estrogen specifically important. huge cause
morbidity, right? So, know, age 65 fall break
hip, one year morbidity 30 40%. again, just put English,
65 older, fall break hip, 30 40% chance dead
year. - [Andrew] Wow. - Bones matter. want really get sense
stack age, sex. anywhere off pace,
ramp strategy super aggressive increase that,
minimum, prevent decay. - age-related charts sorts
things? - Yeah, gets spit called Z-score. looking
BMD, going give Z-score. Z-score zero means,
understand this, like, Z-score referring probability distribution standard
mode. Z-score zero means 50th percentile age sex. Z-
score plus one, one standard deviation above, minus one, below, et cetera.
also T-score, thing, comparing young
person. T-score technically used make diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis. tend look Z-score, basically say, look, Z-
score right now minus one, four years want Z-score zero. Not
necessarily increased entire way, maybe increased
slightly

00:22:33 Bone Mineral Density & Age-Related Decline, Strength Training,
Corticosteroids

expected would've declined. - see. things can
improve bone mineral density age? - turns real critical
window malleable. depending age someone's
listening us discuss this, know, 20, 25, still time


life able reach potential. turns strength training
probably single best thing can do. surprise me, 'cause we,
know, AMA topic little ago, got really deep
analysts. assumption running must best, like sort
impact must best thing can do. know, assumed running better
swimming cycling. turned power lifting probably best
thing do. think understand bones work, became
clear, is, know, power lifting really putting sheer force
muscle via tendon onto bone, bones really sensing.
sensing sheer force applied bone, compressive
way, depending bone course. basically activating
osteoblasts, cells allowing bone built. turns
probably important females, high can get period
development, say till 20 25, basically sets trajectory rest
life. get real trouble patients who, example, used large
amounts inhaled steroids period life, 'cause say really
bad asthma. patients needed large amounts corticosteroids
immune-related condition. critical window development,
taking drug impairing process. So, know, patients like
practice just enormous liability working really hard
overcome, nutrition, hormones, drugs, training. And, know,
just something aware of. - wasn't aware inhalants asthma
things sort can impair bone mineral density. - steroid-based.
course just beta-agonists, fine. - anything corticosteroid like?
- Yep. - Interesting. always get asked question, always reflexively
want say no, don't really know answer don't reply. topical
corticosteroid? know, people will put cortisone cream. me, seems almost
inconceivable systemic effect, again, know? -
dose time-related. So, know, talking like got little rash
skin, going put corticosteroids on, probably not. certainly,
enough put on, mean absorbed, issue. not typically
concerned with. mean, mostly concerned people taking
even modest amounts prednisone months, years time. Or, like said, kids
using steroid inhalers years years years. Again, not suggesting


kid's steroid inhaler shouldn't be. solve important
problem, asthma important problem, it. think just want
turn into, okay, well, much imperative kid things
putting high amount stress bones, via muscles, make sure
maximal capacity build. - think somebody 30s 40s
50s still benefit strength training terms bone mineral density
longevity, relates bone mineral density, given key window earlier,
might missed one. - Oh yeah, no, no, essential rest life
now trying prevent fall off. basically way works
sort of, birth say 20 growth. 20 50, plateau. 50, men
start decline, really small. Women start decline precipitous. -
related drop estrogen associated menopause premenopause? - [Peter]
Correct. - can get broad contours strength training
looks like? Dr. Andy Galpin show, talked lot ways build
strength versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera. think pretty good
agreement across fields physiotherapy, et cetera, physiology medicine,
terms that. understanding fairly low repetition ranges,
anywhere one six repetitions. Typically not aiming pump hypertrophy,
sort thing. heavy loads hard move, 80% one repetition maximum
more, done long rest periods, two three times week type thing,
right? - Yeah, look literature this, going tell you, going
differentiate power lifting weightlifting. words, yeah, need kind
moving heavy load. Now again, can look different depending
level experience. Like really like deadlifting. Now, mean, can count
number days left life going want sets 400 pounds. But,
know, pick choose days do. But, know, grew
things, comfortable movements. 60-year-old woman never
lifted weights life, now get lifting, mean, get
deadlift, think, wouldn't make perfect enemy good. happy put
leg press machine just get that. know, not pure
movement deadlift, cares, right? can still put heavy load,
her, safely. So, now said, mean, study done
Australia, I'm, know, hopefully can find link it. video
YouTube actually kind PI sort walking results. send


you. - [Andrew] Okay, yeah track down. - just amazing. took
group older women. looked like 60s 70s, never
lifted weights life, osteopenia, probably already
osteoporosis, basically just put strength training protocol.
remarkable watch women. good mornings. dead
lifts. picking heavy things off ground. think one woman picking up,
God, want say like picking like 50, 60 kilos off ground. mean, just
staggering sums weight women never done anything.
bone health improving age. goal, frankly, just, know, never get
point first time. Strength training
essential part existence

00:29:24 Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training

never late start, never stop. - love advice.
systemic effect local effect? So, instance, say that, well, mother's
late 70s. actually used really strong kids. move
fish tank room long move it, always, really
strong. years, wouldn't call frail means, certainly think
benefit strength training. say start leg
presses start even air squats maybe work pushups,
effects local, meaning just train legs just pushups,
loads applied limbs muscles tissues involved? -
think bulk is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Andrew] need train
whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep mind, diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis based three locations, left hip, right hip, lumbar
spine. So, know, just convention make diagnosis.
think part majority insults occur. Now not
insults, seen people have, know, horrible bone density,
fracturing ankles tibia, fibula, like low tib fib fractures just
walking. clearly bone density outside regions matter. much
really focused on, and, way, know, fall, break wrist,
systemic issue. majority response local response, 'cause really
comes putting load



00:31:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

directly bone, bone, kind, respond laying
bone. - continue today's discussion, like just briefly acknowledge

00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining “Marginal Decade”

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

mineral density basically speaks risk osteoporosis osteopenia.
doesn't sound sexy people age, know. 50-year-old guys listening this,
like, yeah, big deal. 50-year-old woman, huge deal, right? woman
just go menopause, just gone menopause,
enormous risk osteopenia, ultimately osteoporosis, estrogen
single important hormone regulating bone mineral density. can come
back talk case, interesting biomechanics
bones work, estrogen specifically important. huge cause
morbidity, right? So, know, age 65 fall break
hip, one year morbidity 30 40%. again, just put English,
65 older, fall break hip, 30 40% chance dead
year. - [Andrew] Wow. - Bones matter. want really get sense
stack age, sex. anywhere off pace,
ramp strategy super aggressive increase that,
minimum, prevent decay. - age-related charts sorts
things? - Yeah, gets spit called Z-score. looking
BMD, going give Z-score. Z-score zero means,
understand this, like, Z-score referring probability distribution standard
mode. Z-score zero means 50th percentile age sex. Z-
score plus one, one standard deviation above, minus one, below, et cetera.
also T-score, thing, comparing young
person. T-score technically used make diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis. tend look Z-score, basically say, look, Z-
score right now minus one, four years want Z-score zero. Not
necessarily increased entire way, maybe increased
slightly

00:22:33 Bone Mineral Density & Age-Related Decline, Strength Training,
Corticosteroids

expected would've declined. - see. things can
improve bone mineral density age? - turns real critical
window malleable. depending age someone's
listening us discuss this, know, 20, 25, still time


life able reach potential. turns strength training
probably single best thing can do. surprise me, 'cause we,
know, AMA topic little ago, got really deep
analysts. assumption running must best, like sort
impact must best thing can do. know, assumed running better
swimming cycling. turned power lifting probably best
thing do. think understand bones work, became
clear, is, know, power lifting really putting sheer force
muscle via tendon onto bone, bones really sensing.
sensing sheer force applied bone, compressive
way, depending bone course. basically activating
osteoblasts, cells allowing bone built. turns
probably important females, high can get period
development, say till 20 25, basically sets trajectory rest
life. get real trouble patients who, example, used large
amounts inhaled steroids period life, 'cause say really
bad asthma. patients needed large amounts corticosteroids
immune-related condition. critical window development,
taking drug impairing process. So, know, patients like
practice just enormous liability working really hard
overcome, nutrition, hormones, drugs, training. And, know,
just something aware of. - wasn't aware inhalants asthma
things sort can impair bone mineral density. - steroid-based.
course just beta-agonists, fine. - anything corticosteroid like?
- Yep. - Interesting. always get asked question, always reflexively
want say no, don't really know answer don't reply. topical
corticosteroid? know, people will put cortisone cream. me, seems almost
inconceivable systemic effect, again, know? -
dose time-related. So, know, talking like got little rash
skin, going put corticosteroids on, probably not. certainly,
enough put on, mean absorbed, issue. not typically
concerned with. mean, mostly concerned people taking
even modest amounts prednisone months, years time. Or, like said, kids
using steroid inhalers years years years. Again, not suggesting


kid's steroid inhaler shouldn't be. solve important
problem, asthma important problem, it. think just want
turn into, okay, well, much imperative kid things
putting high amount stress bones, via muscles, make sure
maximal capacity build. - think somebody 30s 40s
50s still benefit strength training terms bone mineral density
longevity, relates bone mineral density, given key window earlier,
might missed one. - Oh yeah, no, no, essential rest life
now trying prevent fall off. basically way works
sort of, birth say 20 growth. 20 50, plateau. 50, men
start decline, really small. Women start decline precipitous. -
related drop estrogen associated menopause premenopause? - [Peter]
Correct. - can get broad contours strength training
looks like? Dr. Andy Galpin show, talked lot ways build
strength versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera. think pretty good
agreement across fields physiotherapy, et cetera, physiology medicine,
terms that. understanding fairly low repetition ranges,
anywhere one six repetitions. Typically not aiming pump hypertrophy,
sort thing. heavy loads hard move, 80% one repetition maximum
more, done long rest periods, two three times week type thing,
right? - Yeah, look literature this, going tell you, going
differentiate power lifting weightlifting. words, yeah, need kind
moving heavy load. Now again, can look different depending
level experience. Like really like deadlifting. Now, mean, can count
number days left life going want sets 400 pounds. But,
know, pick choose days do. But, know, grew
things, comfortable movements. 60-year-old woman never
lifted weights life, now get lifting, mean, get
deadlift, think, wouldn't make perfect enemy good. happy put
leg press machine just get that. know, not pure
movement deadlift, cares, right? can still put heavy load,
her, safely. So, now said, mean, study done
Australia, I'm, know, hopefully can find link it. video
YouTube actually kind PI sort walking results. send


you. - [Andrew] Okay, yeah track down. - just amazing. took
group older women. looked like 60s 70s, never
lifted weights life, osteopenia, probably already
osteoporosis, basically just put strength training protocol.
remarkable watch women. good mornings. dead
lifts. picking heavy things off ground. think one woman picking up,
God, want say like picking like 50, 60 kilos off ground. mean, just
staggering sums weight women never done anything.
bone health improving age. goal, frankly, just, know, never get
point first time. Strength training
essential part existence

00:29:24 Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training

never late start, never stop. - love advice.
systemic effect local effect? So, instance, say that, well, mother's
late 70s. actually used really strong kids. move
fish tank room long move it, always, really
strong. years, wouldn't call frail means, certainly think
benefit strength training. say start leg
presses start even air squats maybe work pushups,
effects local, meaning just train legs just pushups,
loads applied limbs muscles tissues involved? -
think bulk is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Andrew] need train
whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep mind, diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis based three locations, left hip, right hip, lumbar
spine. So, know, just convention make diagnosis.
think part majority insults occur. Now not
insults, seen people have, know, horrible bone density,
fracturing ankles tibia, fibula, like low tib fib fractures just
walking. clearly bone density outside regions matter. much
really focused on, and, way, know, fall, break wrist,
systemic issue. majority response local response, 'cause really
comes putting load

00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining “Marginal Decade”

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

life able reach potential. turns strength training
probably single best thing can do. surprise me, 'cause we,
know, AMA topic little ago, got really deep
analysts. assumption running must best, like sort
impact must best thing can do. know, assumed running better
swimming cycling. turned power lifting probably best
thing do. think understand bones work, became
clear, is, know, power lifting really putting sheer force
muscle via tendon onto bone, bones really sensing.
sensing sheer force applied bone, compressive
way, depending bone course. basically activating
osteoblasts, cells allowing bone built. turns
probably important females, high can get period
development, say till 20 25, basically sets trajectory rest
life. get real trouble patients who, example, used large
amounts inhaled steroids period life, 'cause say really
bad asthma. patients needed large amounts corticosteroids
immune-related condition. critical window development,
taking drug impairing process. So, know, patients like
practice just enormous liability working really hard
overcome, nutrition, hormones, drugs, training. And, know,
just something aware of. - wasn't aware inhalants asthma
things sort can impair bone mineral density. - steroid-based.
course just beta-agonists, fine. - anything corticosteroid like?
- Yep. - Interesting. always get asked question, always reflexively
want say no, don't really know answer don't reply. topical
corticosteroid? know, people will put cortisone cream. me, seems almost
inconceivable systemic effect, again, know? -
dose time-related. So, know, talking like got little rash
skin, going put corticosteroids on, probably not. certainly,
enough put on, mean absorbed, issue. not typically
concerned with. mean, mostly concerned people taking
even modest amounts prednisone months, years time. Or, like said, kids
using steroid inhalers years years years. Again, not suggesting


kid's steroid inhaler shouldn't be. solve important
problem, asthma important problem, it. think just want
turn into, okay, well, much imperative kid things
putting high amount stress bones, via muscles, make sure
maximal capacity build. - think somebody 30s 40s
50s still benefit strength training terms bone mineral density
longevity, relates bone mineral density, given key window earlier,
might missed one. - Oh yeah, no, no, essential rest life
now trying prevent fall off. basically way works
sort of, birth say 20 growth. 20 50, plateau. 50, men
start decline, really small. Women start decline precipitous. -
related drop estrogen associated menopause premenopause? - [Peter]
Correct. - can get broad contours strength training
looks like? Dr. Andy Galpin show, talked lot ways build
strength versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera. think pretty good
agreement across fields physiotherapy, et cetera, physiology medicine,
terms that. understanding fairly low repetition ranges,
anywhere one six repetitions. Typically not aiming pump hypertrophy,
sort thing. heavy loads hard move, 80% one repetition maximum
more, done long rest periods, two three times week type thing,
right? - Yeah, look literature this, going tell you, going
differentiate power lifting weightlifting. words, yeah, need kind
moving heavy load. Now again, can look different depending
level experience. Like really like deadlifting. Now, mean, can count
number days left life going want sets 400 pounds. But,
know, pick choose days do. But, know, grew
things, comfortable movements. 60-year-old woman never
lifted weights life, now get lifting, mean, get
deadlift, think, wouldn't make perfect enemy good. happy put
leg press machine just get that. know, not pure
movement deadlift, cares, right? can still put heavy load,
her, safely. So, now said, mean, study done
Australia, I'm, know, hopefully can find link it. video
YouTube actually kind PI sort walking results. send


you. - [Andrew] Okay, yeah track down. - just amazing. took
group older women. looked like 60s 70s, never
lifted weights life, osteopenia, probably already
osteoporosis, basically just put strength training protocol.
remarkable watch women. good mornings. dead
lifts. picking heavy things off ground. think one woman picking up,
God, want say like picking like 50, 60 kilos off ground. mean, just
staggering sums weight women never done anything.
bone health improving age. goal, frankly, just, know, never get
point first time. Strength training
essential part existence

00:29:24 Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training

never late start, never stop. - love advice.
systemic effect local effect? So, instance, say that, well, mother's
late 70s. actually used really strong kids. move
fish tank room long move it, always, really
strong. years, wouldn't call frail means, certainly think
benefit strength training. say start leg
presses start even air squats maybe work pushups,
effects local, meaning just train legs just pushups,
loads applied limbs muscles tissues involved? -
think bulk is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Andrew] need train
whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep mind, diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis based three locations, left hip, right hip, lumbar
spine. So, know, just convention make diagnosis.
think part majority insults occur. Now not
insults, seen people have, know, horrible bone density,
fracturing ankles tibia, fibula, like low tib fib fractures just
walking. clearly bone density outside regions matter. much
really focused on, and, way, know, fall, break wrist,
systemic issue. majority response local response, 'cause really
comes putting load



00:31:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

directly bone, bone, kind, respond laying
bone. - continue today's discussion, like just briefly acknowledge

00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining “Marginal Decade”

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

putting high amount stress bones, via muscles, make sure
maximal capacity build. - think somebody 30s 40s
50s still benefit strength training terms bone mineral density
longevity, relates bone mineral density, given key window earlier,
might missed one. - Oh yeah, no, no, essential rest life
now trying prevent fall off. basically way works
sort of, birth say 20 growth. 20 50, plateau. 50, men
start decline, really small. Women start decline precipitous. -
related drop estrogen associated menopause premenopause? - [Peter]
Correct. - can get broad contours strength training
looks like? Dr. Andy Galpin show, talked lot ways build
strength versus hypertrophy versus endurance, et cetera. think pretty good
agreement across fields physiotherapy, et cetera, physiology medicine,
terms that. understanding fairly low repetition ranges,
anywhere one six repetitions. Typically not aiming pump hypertrophy,
sort thing. heavy loads hard move, 80% one repetition maximum
more, done long rest periods, two three times week type thing,
right? - Yeah, look literature this, going tell you, going
differentiate power lifting weightlifting. words, yeah, need kind
moving heavy load. Now again, can look different depending
level experience. Like really like deadlifting. Now, mean, can count
number days left life going want sets 400 pounds. But,
know, pick choose days do. But, know, grew
things, comfortable movements. 60-year-old woman never
lifted weights life, now get lifting, mean, get
deadlift, think, wouldn't make perfect enemy good. happy put
leg press machine just get that. know, not pure
movement deadlift, cares, right? can still put heavy load,
her, safely. So, now said, mean, study done
Australia, I'm, know, hopefully can find link it. video
YouTube actually kind PI sort walking results. send


you. - [Andrew] Okay, yeah track down. - just amazing. took
group older women. looked like 60s 70s, never
lifted weights life, osteopenia, probably already
osteoporosis, basically just put strength training protocol.
remarkable watch women. good mornings. dead

think bulk is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Andrew] need train
whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep mind, diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis based three locations, left hip, right hip, lumbar

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

you. - [Andrew] Okay, yeah track down. - just amazing. took
group older women. looked like 60s 70s, never
lifted weights life, osteopenia, probably already
osteoporosis, basically just put strength training protocol.
remarkable watch women. good mornings. dead
lifts. picking heavy things off ground. think one woman picking up,
God, want say like picking like 50, 60 kilos off ground. mean, just
staggering sums weight women never done anything.
bone health improving age. goal, frankly, just, know, never get
point first time. Strength training
essential part existence

00:29:24 Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training

never late start, never stop. - love advice.
systemic effect local effect? So, instance, say that, well, mother's
late 70s. actually used really strong kids. move
fish tank room long move it, always, really
strong. years, wouldn't call frail means, certainly think
benefit strength training. say start leg
presses start even air squats maybe work pushups,
effects local, meaning just train legs just pushups,
loads applied limbs muscles tissues involved? -
think bulk is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Andrew] need train
whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep mind, diagnosis osteopenia
osteoporosis based three locations, left hip, right hip, lumbar
spine. So, know, just convention make diagnosis.
think part majority insults occur. Now not
insults, seen people have, know, horrible bone density,
fracturing ankles tibia, fibula, like low tib fib fractures just
walking. clearly bone density outside regions matter. much
really focused on, and, way, know, fall, break wrist,
systemic issue. majority response local response, 'cause really
comes putting load



00:31:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining “Marginal Decade”

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining “Marginal Decade”

Again, can go athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer.
mentioned falling problems falling breaking things, mortality related
that. wonder whether not also health-related effects just weak
bones not just falling breaking bone, dying year later.
obviously severe. think people hear that, people might
think, well, just careful. just move slowly. sit wheelchair
need to, even though might able walk, keeps falling. people
think adopt mentality. benefits high bone mineral
density men women, perhaps independent risk injury? - Well, think
actually inverse just said, right? sort like, sort
able articulate want marginal decade. use thing


practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

practice called marginal decade. Marginal decade last decade life.
everyone will marginal decade. thing can tell absolute
certainty, right? - believe you. - no immortality. no hidden elixir
going help us live be, know, whatever. mean, going last
decade point. outside people die suddenly accident,
us know marginal decade. might not know day
enter it, people, know, old enough, tell them,
last decade life, probably sense are. think exercise
like go patients early them, exquisite detail,
detail ever considered, prompt like 50
questions, lay marginal decade look like. - Wow, serious
exercise. - serious exercise, right? Like what, tell everything going
happen marginal decade. don't know going be, Andrew,
87 97 well, right? might 79 89, don't know. But, know,
really nuanced exploration topic. think that,
stuff just abstract kind nonsense. person can tell
want last decade, can't design program get
there. mean, think it. Someone wants Ironman, take granted
know objective is. able swim 2 1/2 miles.
able get out, take wetsuit off, hop bike, ride 112 miles, get off bike, take
bike shoes off, put run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. Like get it, know
objective is. knowing can train. Can imagine said you,
Andrew, going athletic event year, start training. not going
tell is, just it. playing basketball. know,
swimming Catalina Island. running 100 miles. wouldn't able it.
similarly, don't know marginal decade meant be, no way
train it. - think good exercise anyone everyone
own, regardless age here? hearing - Absolutely. - thinking, need
think last decade might want look like. - Absolutely,
mean, say patients, population
work with. simply no reason everybody shouldn't going
exercise. - sort back script there, figure people
doing, given current health status. - Exactly right, call back casting. first
step is, really delineated objective function looks like,


say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,
need 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, need 50. Okay,
now? Ah, big gap. need now.
obviously higher 30 now, 42 now need
30 40 years, not going cut it. lot fitter. Okay, now
exercise around strength stability. without exception, people,
exercise, will find well need be.
gravity aging vicious people realize, therefore height
glider needs much higher think age, want
able things probably want able 90. - absolutely love
approach. never done terms health. always thought
want accomplish next three six months next year so. - way,
great approach. forecasting. Forecasting fantastic. Forecasting really
good short-term things. doesn't work long-term things. Long-term,
back casting. - back casting approach really appeals career,
well, never anticipate, excuse me. never anticipated podcasting.
point undergraduate, looked professors, like, looks like
pretty good life. seem pretty happy, talked them, figured
need stage order get next rung ladder, just
kind figured back casting kind way, refer it. think
incredibly useful puts questions blood work often get
blood work measure, really nice context highly individualized.
never heard before, so. - give nod Annie Duke. used
always refer reverse engineering, Annie Duke's book, wrote
exact thing called back casting, like, like term back casting
better. think intuitive reverse engineering. - Yeah, real genius
think it,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

say, okay, break metrics can measure? So,
know, described whole bunch things. Okay, just let know,
will require VO2 max 30 milliliters oxygen per minute per kilogram.
person will say, okay, mean? say, well, measure
maximal uptake oxygen, declines 8% 10% per decade.
30, just assume going 90,

00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max



'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

'cause sets many things appropriate bins trajectories. heard
talk prime movers longevity all-risk mortality.
love review little bit us. think know shouldn't smoke
likely die earlier smoke nicotine. neither marijuana
nicotine smoker, feel stable ground there. anytime see smoking
nowadays, people really want distinguish cannabis nicotine.
curious differences terms impact longevity. context,
things anyone everyone can do, do, live longer
basically? - long got? - Well, tell me. tell me. like live, be,
like final decade 90 100. - Oh no, meant long you, yeah
yeah. - No no, just kidding. just kidding. - will spend now
90 talking this? - Well, risk that. top contour fine, know
done lot content this, will give people links depth
content. But, know, say short flight San Diego,
Los Angeles now, got take off landing, don't want kink neck
much thing. just said, hey, know, gimme extended
version three five card. look like? - So, start couple
things already highlighted. smoking, much smoking
increase risk all-cause mortality? reason like talk
called ACM, all-cause mortality, really agnostic die. doesn't
always make sense. mean, talking about, know, specific
intervention, like anti-cancer therapeutic, really care cancer-specific
mortality heart-specific mortality. talk sort broad things,
like talk ACM. So, know, using smoking, smoking approximately
40% increase risk ACM. - translate in, means
shortening life 40%? - No, means point time, 40% greater risk
going die relative non-smoker never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah.
important distinguish. doesn't mean lifespan going 40% less.
means point time, standing there, risk death 40% higher. And,
way, that'll catch you, right? point catches up. High blood pressure.
20 25% increase all-cause mortality. take something really
extreme, like endstage kidney disease. patients dialysis, waiting
organ. again, confounder


underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

underlying condition leads that. It's, know, profound hypertension,
know, significant Type II diabetes uncontrolled. know, enormous,
175% increase ACM. hazard ratio like 2.75. Type II diabetes
probably 1.25 well. 25% increase. another question like,
improve? things improve those? now
comparing low high achievers metrics. look low muscle mass
versus high muscle mass, improvement? pretty significant.
three X. compare low muscle mass people high muscle mass people
age, low muscle mass people three X hazard ratio, 200% increase
all-cause mortality. Now, look data carefully, realize
probably less muscle mass fully that, high association
strength. start just tease strength, can realize strength
probably 3 1/2 X hazard ratio, meaning 250% greater risk,
low strength high strength. - high strength ability move loads 80
90% one repetition? - defined given studies. So, common things
used actually, used purposes experiments make
easy do. don't even think best metrics. usually using like
grip strength, leg extensions, like wall sits, squats, things like that. long can
sit squatted position 90 degrees without support, great
demonstration quad strength. leg extension, know, much weight can
hold long, relative body weight, things like that. know, whole
strength program patients, something called SMA.
strength metrics assessment. put 11 tests really
difficult, know, like dead hang one them. Like long can dead hang
body weight, stuff like that. trying granular insight,
tie back principles. look cardio respiratory fitness, even
profound. look people bottom 25% age sex,
terms VO2 max, compare people just 50th 75th
percentile, talking two X difference roughly, risk ACM.
compare bottom 25% top 2.5%, talking bottom quarter
elite, given age, talking five X. - Wow! - 400% difference all-cause
mortality. probably single strongest association seen modifiable
behavior. - Incredible. say elite, people running
marathons pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. just like VO2 max


that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

that, like VO2 max elite age group. VO2, again,
training deliberately make sure that. wouldn't consider elite
anything anymore, still maintain VO2 max elite age. - consider
elite physician podcaster. guy around. true. terms of, okay,
so- - point like, don't world class athlete

00:44:43 Attia’s Rule Supplementation, “Centenarian Decathlete” Physical Goals

elite here, yeah. - Got it. maybe talk little bit specifics
around training get top two tiers there, seems
enormous positive effects cardiovascular exercise, far greater sorts
numbers see around, just say supplement supplement B. - Well,
that's, know, like whole pet peeve life, right? like, just can't get
enough machinating arguing supplement versus supplement.
feel like shouldn't arguments exercise
house order, know. shouldn't arguing nuance carnivore
diet, versus nuance paleo diet, versus nuance vegan diet, like,
can deadlift body weight 10 reps. Like can come talk
things, something like, just come metrics. Like
VO2 max least 75th percentile able dead hang least
minute, able wall sit least two, like rattle off bunch
relatively low hanging fruit. wish rule said like couldn't talk
anything else health-related. - can make rule. - [Peter] No one'll listen it. -
don't know that. can make whatever rules want. can call Attia's rule.
One thing done podcast, social media is, just borrowing
tradition science, inappropriate name something yourself,
unless scientist 1950. totally appropriate name things
people. going call Attia's rule. can following things,
don't talk supplements. - Please refrain talking supplements
nutrition. - is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, referenced Attia's rule.
coined phrase, not him. no ego involved, now Attia's rule. Watch
out. Hashtag Attia's rule. - Oh God! - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. seriousness,
serious that. Dead hang minute seems like really good goal
lot people. least- - goal. think minute half goal


40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call
centenarian decathlete, person living marginal decade best. -
Well, say certainly



00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

40-year-old woman. Two minutes goal 40-year-old man. adjust
down, based age gender. - Great. wall sit,
numbers? - don't use wall sit, just straight squat, air squat 90
degrees. believe two minutes standard men women 40. -
Great. then, people thinking terms VO2 max little
complicated, might not access equipment measure it, et cetera,
can talk about, think about, terms cardiovascular. run mile seven
minutes less, eight minutes less? - Oh, good question. really
good VO2 max estimators online, can plug activity de jure,
bike, run, rowing machine, can give sense that. don't, used
know those. - Oh, okay. - now just actually testing, don't
recall them. exactly line thinking, like, can run mile time.
can, VO2 max approximately this. - [Andrew] Great. - think, somewhere
podcast realm, got charts posted like, age, sex.
VO2 max buckets. - Terrific, provide links those.
people find links. mentioned deadlifting body weight
10 times. - just made one up. not one include, but- - [Andrew]
Something like that? - use farmer carries. say male, able
farmer carry body weight for, think two minutes. - [Andrew] Great. -
half body weight hand. able walk two
minutes. women, think 75% body weight something like that,
yeah. - Great. love it. indirect measures healthy and, - Yeah. - are.
long going live. - basically grip strength, mobility. mean, again,
walking much weight, people initially, really hard. know, use
different things like vertical jump, ground contact time jumping off box, things
like that. really trying capture, evolution, right? Like think test
going get involved get involved, 'cause took us
year. Beth Lewis majority work develop this. Beth runs strength
stability program practice. And, know, basically just tasked like, hey,
go literature come best movements think
proxies need like kick-ass, know, call

Well, say certainly

say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

00:49:24 Importance Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours

mechanistic leap, look literature exercise-related neurogenesis
mice, brain atrophy brain hypertrophy, et cetera, animal models, clear
best way get nervous system atrophy, lose neurons, shrink neurons,
lose connections neurons, stop animal moving. de-
enrich environment, deprive sensory input multiple sensory inputs.
best way enhance size neurons, number connections
neurons, maybe even number neurons, enrich environment get
moving enriching environment. - know, Andrew, think difficult
say not true humans. first time became clear
2014, analyst, Dan Pelletier, said, Dan, going give
project vexing no end, is, want look literature
have, mechanistic clinical trial data, talks Alzheimer's prevention.
want know every single type input. want clear sense via
mechanism offer mode protection? took Dan,
obviously, iterated lot together. came back kind amazing
presentation took, don't know, nine months year work. amazed
came back it, said, single greatest efficacy can point
exercise. like Dan, got nonsense, dude. no way exercise
single best thing can brain. drug
missed. thing missed. like, no, like
hands best thing 'cause you're, know, not just
BDNF. not just vascular endothelium. not just
glucose disposal insulin signaling things. just touching every aspect
brain. skeptical six months, kind really pushed
like, think missing something, Dan, think missing something.
finally end, looped Richard Isaacson, neurologist work
really closely Alzheimer's prevention. know, ultimately turned
paper wrote basically, know, topic, others. 'Cause
again, thought, oh, sure not EPA DHA? Like got bigger
impact. again, lot things think matter whole host
things Alzheimer's prevention. think absolutely right.
not one thing tell patients important exercising.


way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

way, not sort pathetic recommendations made. Like it's,
exercise lot want get maximum benefit. will get, know,
maximum benefit comes going nothing something. go
completely sedentary 15 MET hours per week, get probably 50%
reduction risk. - Wow. - MET hour, MET, just people don't know,
metabolic equivalent. exerting 1.3 METs sitting talking.
sitting quiet, one MET. Walking really briskly
five METs. 15 MET hours per week three one hour really brisk walks.
not lot work. just going nothing give
50% benefit get going way. Now I, again, think,
personally little skeptical much that's, think probably bit less that.
think upside people appreciate. studies, don't think, can truly
capture that. look, know, no reason not exercising that,
capture benefit, even though rate accrue less. also
speaks health span side this, not necessarily captured data.
health span gets back functional piece opened with,
want marginal decade? want able pick great-
grandkid, come running you? want able get off floor?
want able play floor kid get own? -
think people thinking final years life, trying think, know,
can take bathroom? thinking, can sit off
toilet? mean like really base, vegetative type functions, right, level.
love this, again, idea marginal decade using way back cast,
actual methods behaviors protocols one daily basis.
use anecdata, now called, cite just, know three Nobel prize winners,
doesn't mean anything except beautiful work. point
90s. name 'cause complimenting done. Not
just work, describe. Eric Kandel Columbia. Nobel prize
winner work memory. Torsten Wiesel, work neuroplasticity. Richard
Axel, also Columbia, Nobel prize winning work molecular biology smelling
molecular biology generally. three still alive, Richard's younger compared
two. three either swim, jog, play tennis, racquetball think
Richard's thing, multiple times per week. cognitively still extremely sharp, still
interested arts, science, curious science, running laboratories, writing


books, going podcasts. mean, incredible. Again, anecdata. kind
surprised learn colleagues intellectually strong also
obsessed exercise. mean, really obsessed exercise routine
early linked their, intellectual vigor time. want just also
use jumping off point ask one kind niche thing, comes up.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus

don't think going one told this, one three
individuals chews excessive amount Nicorette. Used smoker asked
said because, estimation, protective Parkinson's
Alzheimer's, least nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation nicotine, 'cause
nicotine acetylcholine receptor obviously, known create state focus
neural enhancement. thoughts not smoking, just, just want
really clear, people, don't smoke nicotine, vape nicotine, going shorten life.
Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, opinion. thoughts
augmenting acetylcholine, use nicotine, order keep brain healthy
focused? Again, one Nobel prize winner, truly N one,
convinced matches mechanistic data acetylcholine cognition,
love hear thoughts it. - can't speak AD prevention
component it. run couple colleagues collaborate
that. can definitely speak cognitive enhancement piece it. actually
AMA this, probably year ago, went gory details
talked use nicotine, cycle off,
last 10 years. haven't- - form take in? - used use gum. don't like
gum anymore, now like little lozenges that, tell funny story
this. mutual acquaintance, David Sinclair, mentioned company
year ago. like, hey, heard company? forget name
company, gave name. go online like company selling
nicotine. like, wonder asking this. Well, just order bunch
figure why, 'cause were, know, reason
potentially investment. get a, like literally order like lifetime
supply stuff. pretty good, actually, really nice little patch, 'cause I,
thing didn't like gum hated just taste it. next week


talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

talking David like, way, ordered nicotine stuff told
about. like what? goes, oh, company's name something else.
totally unrelated. like, oh God. short answer is, think stuff
absolutely concentration-enhancing substance. addictive people need
wary that. Now not addictive everybody. personally experience no addiction
whatsoever. can, every day 30 days stop experience no
withdrawal. forget it, doesn't really seem matter.
careful dose, truthfully. mean, remember one cigarette one milligram
nicotine, lot lozenges will plow four eight milligrams one
shot. someone is, know, naive that, like am, four milligrams lot
nicotine one bolus. just mindful it. got lot flack
AMA, obvious reasons, people like, can you, doctor,
encourage people use nicotine. like, first all, not encouraging
anybody use it. just want able talk biochemistry it.
disclosing use time time endorsement apologize that.
list things can make brain little focused,
consider infinitely safer lot people doing, using
stimulants. mean, me, know, just tell patients outright, like no
circumstance prescribing stimulants. mean, yeah, not giving anybody Adderall.
not giving anybody Vyvanse, things. Not say don't
appropriate clinical use, prescribed care somebody
really monitoring use case it. using tool enhance,
know, concentration cognitive performance not something comfortable doing.
- Yeah, rampant college campuses. - [Peter] can imagine. - Armodafinil,
modafinil slightly different, course, but, non-clinical use, not prescribed
ADHD, just, rampant. Recreational use, study-based use. - data
seen modafinil suggests really provides nootropic benefit. someone
deprived sleep. data totally well-rested person,
nootropic benefit modafinil? - don't know. one experience armodafinil,
took half recommended dose, prescribed doctor. went give
talk. Hawaii four hours talk. co-speaker came
just said, well, first all, got little bit spit corner mouth.
second all, haven't blinked three minutes. third, two people left
audience. lazered kind forgot context. Now little bit a,


kind tunnel vision, OCD-type anyway, one, took, never took
it. powerful stimulant. take 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC now
again, cognitive work, sometimes workouts, subjectively
feel narrows focus nice way. don't take twice
day, twice week. - See, example where, know
talking exercise versus sort nutrition supplements longevity.
think may whole bunch things kind interesting around focus,
nothing compare changing environment. Like think compare
focus today focus college, no comparison. Like college,
truly robot. think large part was, no distraction. no
email. no social media. no internet. mean, college
Mosaic launched early '90s. Like I, know, walk like mile
get computer lab big Sun workstation anything in, know,
computer code language. sitting room studying, no
distraction. think far greater component means focused,
challenges today. So, know, thoughts be,
really wanted return state focus, going individually
something about, know, environment. don't know answer is. Like,
tried every little trick can think of, like closing browsers writing
stuff, but, know, just not strong enough willed. Like pick phone every 20
minutes look see missed text message something stupid. - pretty
infrequent. episode habits looking data. seems people
getting interrupted interrupting every three minutes
typical workplace, now typical changed lot people working home.
put phone away try work, nothing focuses like deadline.
little bit fear-based urgency. it, grant deadlines, know, drop deadlines
call them, podcasts going record today, nothing works quite like it.
life. Well, thanks offshoot nicotine. Again, not
recommending it, not recommending it, clear augmenting
acetylcholine system, nicotine various forms, related
type pharmacology, enhance focus pretty potently. think going
interesting area real clinical trials things sort.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause



Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

Love chat hormone therapies, hormones generally. Robert Sapolsky
came podcast, talked little bit menopause data around
menopause. interested findings that, think going get right,
whether not women benefit estrogen therapy offset menopause really
depends therapy initiated. don't know aware data,
claimed begin estrogen therapy middle tail end menopause,
outcomes can quite bad. Whereas initiate estrogen therapies
enter menopause even menopause, outcomes can quite good.
don't know percentage patients treat male versus female,
ages patients course, thoughts estrogen therapy
women, menopause, hormone therapies generally women, maybe even
testosterone therapy, hear days, talk men. -
practice probably 70 30 male female. lots women,
important topic. also probably, let think. just want make sure not
hyperbolic say this. Yeah, don't think am. hands biggest screw
entire medical field last 25 years. Now, again, possible next hour
think of, nope, bigger screw up. - Another giant screw up. - Yeah, don't
think will. pretty confident won't able think bigger act
incompetence happened women's health initiative late '90s
early 2000s, effectively study turned entire medical field off
hormone replacement therapy women. important, think, explain
study looked at. study conducted response widely held
belief '70s '80s women placed hormones going
menopause, right? Menopause is, guess maybe even take step back.
don't know much audience familiar estrogen progesterone work.
worth going stuff? - Yeah probably worth mentioning bit top contour.
might familiar it, done episodes estrogen testosterone,
frankly, think back those, didn't really go biology estrogen
testosterone enough. - Yeah, so, mean, actually interesting aside always tell
female patients get kick this. look woman's labs,
see estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, things. based units reported
in, distorting picture common androgen body.


actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

actually convert units, much testosterone body
estrogen. - Interesting. - Yeah. - not know that. - Yeah. - again, never
woman getting hormone profile. - Yeah, yeah. even though woman's
testosterone much less man's level, still estrogen
body. - [Andrew] Wow! - phenotypically, right, estrogen hormone
dominating test, the, much higher estrogen man much
lower testosterone man, absolute amounts, testosterone
estrogen. Just worth pointing out. - [Andrew] Incredible. - So, know,
happening woman age starts menstruating goes
menopause, outside pregnancy birth control stuff like that,
cycle, know, roughly every 28 days, can vary, beginning
period, call day zero, basic, estrogen progesterone low.
can't measure them. happens estrogen level starts rise,
rises response hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, getting
ready ovulate. ovulates midpoint cycle. just
going make math easy, day 14 going release follicle one
ovaries. estrogen level sort rising, rising, rising. love measure
hormones day five, want standardized way measure
hormones. women know business trying understand
hormones, day period starts, even just day spotting, becomes
benchmark, day five, want see every hormone day.
everything going well, know FSH, LH, estradiol progesterone
day. estrogen rises, starts come little bit ovulates,
luteinizing hormone kicks now going prepare uterus
lining accommodate pregnancy. now start see estradiol go back,
now, first time, progesterone goes up. progesterone nothing
14 days, now starts rise. actually progesterone hormone
dominating second half, called luteal cycle. first 14 days
follicular cycle. Second luteal cycle. get halfway point
that, now, just math, 21 days in, body figured
pregnant not. again, time not going pregnant. body
says, oh, don't need lining preparing, going shed it. now
progesterone estrogen start crashing, lining shed,
menses. way, last seven days cycle, susceptible


woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

woman creates PMS symptoms. the, actually, something
probably better understanding me. something
susceptible woman, enormous reduction progesterone quickly
probably impacting something brain. legitimate thing, right? mean,
know, not like, oh, crazy PMS symptoms.
No. know case put women progesterone
seven days, symptoms go away. - [Andrew] Interesting. - can stabilize
progesterone last half luteal phase, sometimes just
entire luteal phase, just put low dose progesterone, PMS
symptoms vanish. - interesting. look progesterone
receptors located brain. Allen Brain Institute now beautiful data
situ hybridization, for, 'cause don't understand is, looking RNA sort
genes proteins expressed human brain, using actual
human brain tissue sections opposed just mice. take look, think- - Yeah,
really curious, yeah. - insight progesterone emotionality link
might be, might exist, neural circuit wise. - then, estrogen
progesterone reach nadir again, starts cycle. just, cycle
happening again.

01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk

Okay, became well known '50s that, okay, woman's going stop
menstruating point, estrogen goes down. don't just give
estrogen? 'Cause clearly going help symptoms menopause.
women experience go menopause? first symptoms
called vasomotor symptoms. usually form night sweats,
hot flashes. So, depending woman, can really significant, right?
women can hard time sleeping. can hot flashes
middle day. can wake soaked pool sweat. tend pass
couple years, get sort long-term complications
menopause. call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, stuff
talked ago, osteopenia osteoporosis. lot women will
complain brain fog. So, mean, clearly issue recognized 70
years ago. don't give women estrogen back replace hormone?


went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

went couple decades, maybe less, maybe decade,
realized, wait minute, driving risk uterine cancer. reason
just give estrogen no progesterone antagonize it, will thicken
endometrium endlessly will increase risk hyperplasia. Well,
definitely undergo hyperplasia, ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia precancerous,
ultimately seeing that. people figured out, well, actually, want
give estrogen woman still uterus, give progesterone
well. able hormone oppose estrogen.
became effectively in, call 1970s-ish, standard HRT. early 1990s
NIH said, look, haven't really studied this. ton epidemiology
says giving women hormones seems really good things. feel better,
symptoms go away. seem lower risk heart disease, lower risk of,
know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk cardiovascular disease, lower risk
bone fractures. Everything seems get better. Lower risk diabetes. haven't
tested randomized prospective trial, this. became WHI.
randomized, two parallel arms. group women not
uterus. women undergone hysterectomy
reason. group women uterus. first group,
placebo arm estrogen arm. group,
progesterone plus estrogen versus placebo. Everything way study
done bit wonky. justifiable, important understand. First,
women way outside menopause. none women started
normally start HRT. probably several reasons that,
one is, think legitimate reason, wanted hard outcomes.
wanted know death rates. women 50s,
just weren't going get it, right. couldn't- - Wait long. - Yeah, got wait
long. going like seven 10-year study.
women much older. also disproportionately took much sicker women.
believe prevalence, again, going get numbers wrong
people going get phosphorylated, but, know, mean, ballpark,
right? Something like 30, 40% women smokers. prevalence
obesity, diabetes enormous. really disproportionately picked
unhealthy population could, pretty advanced age. again, think part
say, look, want make sure seven years, really know


difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

difference causes death. thing is, kind weird,
although again, understand rationale it, great example
careful look clinical trial, remotely represents patients
interested treating. also treated no patients symptomatic.
rationale being, include study patients symptomatic,
randomized placebo will drop out. - Okay, makes sense terms study design,
makes no sense study design intended mimic real world. - right.
now just keep track three issues. disproportionately unhealthy
patient population not symptomatic, starting 10 years
menopause. next thing did, again, understand it,
now fourth strike study, is, spoken PI
study asked question point blank. actually going podcast
point soon go detail, use conjugated equine
estrogen, MPA, synthetic form progesterone. - [Andrew] Horse- - Yes. -
estrogen? - horse urine, collect horse urine, getting, it's- - Horses
urinate lot. least urinate, seems like large volume urine,
observed. - [Peter] lot experience this? - No, but, know,
sister rode horses little while, high school girlfriend horse,
thing, mean pees legendary. male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah,
conjugated equine estrogen estrogen collected female horses.
synthetic progesterone. said person, said, well, didn't
use use today, bio-identical estrogen progesterone. Like today,
put women estrogen, use a, FDA product called Vivelle-Dot.
patch just put on, estradiol, bioidentical estradiol.
use called micronized progesterone. bio-identical progesterone.
said, well, time just wanted test currently used. said,
totally makes sense. again, now four considerations keep
mind, okay. despite four considerations, going make case
think MPA created real problem study, synthetic
progesterone, preliminary results first made available, not yet peer-
reviewed not yet published, huge fiasco, huge press announcement
it, suggesting women receiving CEE plus MPA, group
uterus, higher incidence breast cancer. basically became headline
never went away, though turned not true. talk numbers.


increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

increase risk breast cancer group? gets one
my, know, ever listen podcast rail something. - Listen,
3,800 pet peeves counting. laboratory staff know these, know good
number them. So, not - Here, add one them. - apologize
many pet peeves. long experience data support
them, provides- - one biggest pet peeves is, team knows 'cause
sometimes occasionally, know, remind them,
never talk relative risk change without absolute risk accommodating it, right.
So, look like? relative risk increase breast cancer
estrogen plus MPA group versus placebo 25, 27%. became
headline. HRT increases risk breast cancer 27%. Now, don't think true
today, even look data. ARR? absolute risk
increase? difference five cases per thousand four cases per
thousand. ARR 0.1%, one case thousand. true, going four
thousand five thousand 25% increase, completely inappropriate
context. - agree, feel like headlines sort, come recently
around various dietary interventions, won't go there, least not time being,
nothing short criminal really distort people's thinking. also
steer course science medicine for, pointed out, decades, not
longer. can really take us off health track serious ways. - bring
meandering close, say, even though spend next hour talking
ways study flawed, unethical things
done number investigators went way mask
truth study world, tell woman today, going start
going menopause. using bio-identical hormones.
upper bound risk breast cancer one case thousand, least weigh
benefits, talk about. Now, something else
want say, moment ago alluded fact think MPA might
biggest issue study. two findings study
negative. One small increase risk heart disease, small increase
risk breast cancer. consider group, forgot group
didn't uterus. 'Cause remember, women got estrogen versus placebo.
difference breast cancer there? Well, interesting 'cause didn't
reach statistical significance, P value 0.06 0.07. came close,


opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

opposite direction. 24% risk reduction, one thousand
well. estrogen plus MPA, barely statistically significant,
P value 0.05, just hit statistical significance, one thousand cases breast
cancer. one thousand cases, P value 0.07, reduction
risk breast cancer. suggests MPA, synthetic progesterone,
playing role anything else. second thing point oral
estrogen, no longer use, increase coagulability. increase
ability blood clot little bit. look recent data HRT,
using topical estrogen patches estrogen, don't see all. fact, see
opposite now. now see risk heart disease going women
estradiol. - women will arriving treatments mutations
things like Factor V Leiden clotting factors. appropriate say
everyone, male female, know whether not mutant forms
Factor V Leiden? - know, don't typically test people Factor V. wife actually
it, didn't learn HELLP syndrome giving birth first
daughter. But, know, kind look family history reason testing
things like that. take pretty detailed family history,

01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies Women

kind look clotting issues there. - about, reflex nowadays
put women topical estrogen therapies? - Well basically
discussion, right? still struggle, right, is, know,
me, prefer woman's HRT provided GYN, want
able work partnership GYN like see endometrial
ultrasound done every year. That's, know, argue overkill,
think pap smear every year well. looking
cervix, want look endometrium, want make sure lining isn't
thick. thing say, Andrew, today, now realize not women
can tolerate estro, pardon me, progesterone. careful. assuming,
again, woman still uterus, estrogen solves problems,
decide, can tolerate progesterone? needs be, given
systemically like hundred 200 milligrams. women, lifesaving
intervention. mean, start sleeping better, hair gets thicker, feel better.


women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

women, literally drives crazy. probably reciprocal
seeing case women PMS. situations say, great,
done oral progesterone. just use progesterone coated IUD. get
local progesterone uterus protection, systemic estrogen. -
Fascinating. oral contraception women? use estrogen
chronically people's, know, college years 20s, 30s, maybe even teens,
knows. known long-term effects, any? - got honest
you, don't think know enough comment it. not something really impacts
patient population. least see, women using IUDs
contraception OCs. mean, use OCs sometimes women
premenopausal, symptomatic control, typically use like low low estrin,
low synthetic estrogen, don't like using much.
thing can get control certain symptoms, use like half cycle.
typically not something experienced with. - testosterone,
mentioned that, know, nanogram per mill, said everything
same, know, guess nanogram per deciliter, - Yeah yeah. -
kind normalize everything. - Versus picogram per ML. - Right, yeah. so,
Peter pointing look charts
different measures, normalize, testosterone actually higher
estrogen women. surprise me. prescribe testosterone therapy
women ever? - sometimes, much caution don't
data, right. I'll, know, say is, look, mean, now
really outside area can point lot data. Like comes
estrogen progesterone, happily go toe toe anybody wants make
case dangerous. Similarly, comes using testosterone men,
spend day, can go literature person cries wants
just call uncle, right. comes to- - prescribe testosterone. -
comes estrogen in, testosterone women, don't data. love
see trial done. sweet spot, reconcile that? not
something consider standard. basically, woman is, testosterone, first
all, staggeringly low, again, even though testosterone's low compared
male, still range. really bottom range, really
difficulty putting muscle mass really complaining low libido, think
situation, go ahead use topical testosterone, and, know, replace


level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear
HRT, think about, super physiological seems term. - Yeah, like never
seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

level still physiologically normal. - Yeah, key people hear

seen single symptom single woman put testosterone on, terms like
acne, body hair, things like that. Like real symptoms aware
of, but, know, like clitoral enlargement things like that, like doesn't happen
physiologic normal conditions.

01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin

- love talk little bit hormone replacement therapy men. one looks
social media internet, seems younger younger cohort
guys people teens 20s, showing table thinking injecting
testosterone cypionate taking Anavar, whatever is, going right idea.
mainly seem focused cosmetic effects. not physician, can't say
whether not actually hypogonadal et cetera, seems me, again,
correct wrong, seems similar Attia's rule relates
longevity, come broad contour rule male age
not trying get decent sleep, exercise appropriately, appropriate nutrition, minding
social connections, et cetera, et cetera, idea going straight testosterone
seems like bad idea. said, just like depression antidepressants,
kind cliff low enough testosterone, low enough serotonin, prevents
people sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. want
acknowledge that. mind, think about, perhaps
occasionally prescribe direct patients terms hormone replacement therapy
men, person 30s, person 40s, almost things
correctly. sorts levels think meaningful? range
tremendous terms blood tests. 300 nanograms deciliter, think low end
now U.S., way 900 1200, enormous range.
hormones like look at, estrogen, DHT on? - So, lot
unpack there. So, start ranges, right? ranges gave total
testosterone, course, don't spend lot time looking way we,
know, used spend time looking total free used tricks
modulate it. actually far simple manipulation testosterone today
six seven years ago. Six seven years ago, mean, were, know,


use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

use micro dose Anavar lower SHBG person normal
testosterone, low free testosterone. - low dose Anavar context?
- 10 milligrams subling two three times week. - Anavar basically DHT.
Oxandrolone- - Yeah, oxandrolone, yeah exactly. - again, not recommending
this. actually, playing competitive sport, can get banned
sport. - No no, yeah yeah. is- - can also get banned children
incorrectly. - Yeah, micro dose small enough
doesn't impair body's ability make testosterone. Anavar high
affinity SHBG, basically distracts SHBG binding testosterone. -
Freeing testosterone. - exactly right. goal was, just give
free testosterone? patient shows got total testosterone
900 nanograms per deciliter, place at, know, depending
scale look at, scale look at, place 70th percentile.
free testosterone is, know, eight nanograms per deciliter. pretty
bad. means less 1% free. guy 2% free T.
dude closer 16 18 nanograms per deciliter. situation just
gave you, SHBG really high. SHBG probably 80 90 range. -
high. 'Cause think upper range somewhere around 55, 56. - Exactly. - Yeah.
- first back stall driving SHBG. basically three
hormones, genetics plays huge role this. no question just
box, people different like set point SHBG. Mine incredibly low. SHBG
like kind 30s, 20s 30s. hormone perspective, basically
three hormones run it. estradiol probably important, insulin
thyroxine. going look decide playing
role. insulin suppresses it. actually great irony helping person get
metabolically healthy, short run, can actually lower free testosterone,
things equal. insulin comes down, SHBG goes up, testosterone
hasn't gone it, lowering free testosterone. - somebody goes
low carbohydrate diet attempt drop water drop weight,
going increase SHBG? - Yeah, insulin goes enough. - Bind
testosterone, less free testosterone. can tell carnivore diet people going
coming bone marrow hand. again, discussion extends
little further, sure vegans will coming celery stalks, a. -
estradiol. except opposite direction. higher


estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

estradiol higher SHBG. again, occasionally see guy normal
testosterone, high aromatase activity person. lot
enzyme converts testosterone estradiol. can lower estradiol bit
aromatase inhibitor, can bring SHBG. Now, again, things
individually rarely enough move needle. last thyroxine.
person whose thyroid whack, fix you, T4
whack, going interfere SHBG. also supplements
think probably talked podcast. feel like heard talk
podcast. - Yeah, will adjust, know,
idea now much better review, just came out, send you, love
thoughts it, perusing line line. love input experts
like use Tongkat Ali reducing SHBG. experience, free
testosterone. mechanism isn't exactly clear. effects aren't
dramatic. Right, probably multiple effects. know, increases libido,
does, generally, way increasing estrogen slightly, can also increase libido
individuals. don't know exact mode action. talked
few. one years back people claiming reduce SHBG
stinging nettles. - Stinging nettles, yeah. - Stinging nettle, well just, urinating seems
coming multiple times podcast, whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract,
took, pronounced effect basically urinate car
taking SHBG. underlying mechanism was, not know. took
short while, didn't drop SHBG much, drop DHT sufficiently
stopped taking it. - felt that, yeah. - not like anything impedes
DHT. don't care hairline retreats, don't care that. DHT
something coveted held onto feel much better DHT
appropriate range, love thoughts that. - Yeah, again- -
point too. - really depends guy, depends risk trying
manage, right. prostate size starts become one issues DHT. - Luckily
prostate-specific antigen low, DHT, things know can reduce
things like finasteride, Propecia, things like, yeah, right. Things people take try
avoid hair loss can dramatically reduce DHT lead sorts terrible sexual
side effects, mood-based side effects, et cetera. yeah, not aware anything
taken supplement form can really profoundly drop SHBG. - Yeah,
don't spend much attention anymore. Basically, used much


complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago. Like, mean was, drive
patients nuts whiteboard diagrams draw them, end,
think just like, dude, just, need take? Today take much
simple approach. first question is, free
testosterone higher? metric care about, free testosterone first,
important, second important estradiol. - sorry interrupt, said,
look total testosterone, want free T 2% total. -
Well, be, right. Now can't, might not change anymore. words,
guy's 1%, know really boost total testosterone.
going get one 1 1/2% converted free, need boost him.
don't care outside range. Like, guy free T, might get
guy's total T 1500 get free T 18. - see, free T target. like
approach. - Free T treat. - still use Anavarax, - don't use- -
oxandrolone, sorry, try lower SHBG. - don't, no. - potent? - No,
just complicated patients. drug can't taken orally,
take tongue. - Like troche something. - Right, then,
know, one patient who, even though told 87 times that,
like swallowing Anavars liver function, like, talking 10
milligrams three times week tiny dose, three months him, whatever, two
months swallowing every time tripled liver function test. like,
like, know, just not worth hassle for, know, perfection.
reality, can fix another way. first order question is, believe clinically
will benefit normalizing free testosterone, taking level, call
80th 90th percentile. upper normal limit physiologic ranges. first order
question. going come symptoms, going come
biomarkers. think there's, two years ago, two years ago maybe year
ago, good study came looked pre-diabetic men, probably talked
study, looking insulin resistance glucose disposal without
testosterone. evidence overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves
glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. shouldn't surprising
way, given role muscles play glucose reservoir glucose sink. now
include one things will consider factor using testosterone.
Now, again, not one. can accomplish exercise, can
accomplish things, get little bit vicious


cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

cycle will normalized testosterone facilitate things better.
just assume come decision person good candidate
testosterone replacement therapy. next question is, method going
do. going indirectly directly? Now used use lot Clomid
practice.

01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG

talked Clomid pod? - Haven't talked much it. No,
talked little bit fact people taking things like anastrozole
reduce aromatase activity, can potentially run trouble think, oh well,
testosterone, good, lower estrogen, bad, end issues like joint
pain, memory issues, severe drops libido. think lot reason why- -
even fat accumulation. estrogen low, can develop adiposity way
wouldn't otherwise. great New England Journal paper, probably
10 years old now, looked at, believe five different doses testosterone
cypionate. men chemically castrated divided 10 groups.
pretty remarkable- - [Andrew] somebody signed study. - Yeah,
without anastrozole five doses testosterone. now basically
five testosterone levels, plus minus high low estradiol. results
really clear higher testosterone estradiol kind
30 50 range, better were. estrogen low, even
presence high testosterone, outcomes less significant. - 30 50
nanograms per decile, not 30 50% one's testosterone. Okay, great. No, haven't
talked, Clomid is, know, not talked lot Clomid. love get
thoughts Clomid. - Clomiphene fertility drug. synthetic hormone.
actually two drugs, M Clomiphene forget one. tells pituitary
secrete FSH LH. you, advantage Clomid oral, meant
taken orally. So, know, typical starting dose like 50 milligrams three
times week. that, notice, men, especially young men, FSH
LH goes up. man, FSH LH go up, man still testicular
reserve, make lots testosterone response that. 'Cause first order
question trying answer you, failure make testosterone central
peripheral? - Yeah, think, just want point out, again, correct wrong,


understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

understanding lot drugs talking about, synthetic
compounds, testosterone, estrogen, things related growth hormone, et cetera,
discovered designed order treat, excuse me, order isolate treat
exactly kinds syndromes, whether not hypothalamus, pituitary,
target tissue, ovaries testes. Correct? - Correct, yeah. mean, think,
easiest way go just give hormone missing, without
attention deficiency is. becomes relevant 35-year-
old guy whose testosterone low, can demonstrate low
not getting enough signal pituitary, bother giving
testosterone Leydig cells Sertoli cells make testosterone.
just needs signal. Sometimes, though not always, just course Clomid can wake
up, back making normal testosterone. - three times
week, 50 milligrams, three times week, short course, then? - Yeah,
eight 12 weeks reevaluate. - estrogen testosterone
will increase parallel. - Yes. again, depends, know, aromatase activity
dependent much body fat genetics. estradiol gets high,
think gets 55, 60, will give micro doses anastrozole.
real micro doses. mean, cannot pound people anastrozole. give
perspective, sort on-label use, like just go pharmacy order
anastrozole, going get one milligram tablets. Like can't give anybody
milligram. - [Andrew] feel like garbage. - compounded 0.1
milligrams, might give patient 0.1, two three times week.
big dose anastrozole. - Yeah, think typical TRT clinic giving 200
milligrams per mil, one mil, 200 milligrams testosterone every two weeks,
hitting people multiple milligrams anastrozole, place.
- never really understood, mean, guess shouldn't surprised, kind
blows mind TRT clinics place, given bad. mean,
see results, 'cause patients come them, don't understand like
incompetent. - actually think worse that. think simply
don't understand don't care, pill mill money mill. think
nowadays seems almost everybody TRT taking lower doses
frequently every day, twice week, dividing dose, very,
careful estrogen aromatase blockers. - patients not take
aromatase inhibitors. not needed. really high aromatasers need it.


yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

yeah, talk testosterone, talk dosing there, 'cause
agree. frequently can take better, frankly, don't need go
frequently twice week. - slow-acting. - half-life, yeah,
half life drug is, think 3 1/2 days, plasma half-life something
like that. off little bit, twice week dosing really nice. go like
testosterone clinic giving 200 every two weeks, 50 twice week
total dose, which, way, physiologic dose. not going give somebody
side effects see. not going get acne that. not
going get gynecomastia. not going get anything. real side effect
get will get testicular atrophy. enough suppress. - Yeah,
maintain fertility, typically for? - Well, where, finish
story Clomid, 'cause currently not use Clomid, due really
interesting observation made, don't think reported literature
yet, Clomid increasing levels sterol also happen
measure called desmosterol. - [Andrew] not familiar that. - So, way
cholesterol made, made by, two pathways make cholesterol.
starts like two carbon sub units, like Acetyl-CoA, kind marches
pathway, bifurcates, cholesterol finished product both. one
pathways, molecule right cholesterol called desmosterol,
pathway called lathosterol. constantly measure lathosterol desmosterol,
want know much cholesterol synthesized body. Not
just cholesterol is. want know much cholesterol reabsorb.
markers really important us looking cardiovascular disease
risk. gave patients Clomid, noticing almost universal rise
desmosterol levels. Now, obvious explanation that, though last time
looked, couldn't find clear explanation clinical, like clinical trials
led approval Clomid. don't know described. fact, maybe
wasn't known. suspect inhibiting enzyme, think called delta-24
desaturates, turns desmosterol cholesterol. Makes sense inhibit
enzyme, going see rise desmosterol. wouldn't concern
me, not fact Tom Dayspring, one physicians work with,
one world's experts lipids, pointed obscure story,
first drug ever approved treat cardiovascular disease, least treat
hypercholesterolemia, drug attacked enzyme. early


1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

1960s believe, maybe mid '60s. drug approved lowered cholesterol.
approved basis lowering cholesterol. Now today, no drug
ASCVD approved basis lowering cholesterol. not high enough bar.
reduce events. Actually show preventing heart attacks
death. time like, hey, lowers cholesterol, got good. Well,
late '60s pulled market events going up.
cholesterol coming down, events going up. be? don't
know. suspecting desmosterol, still sterol, potentially
damaging created oxidative stress endothelium, sub-
endothelial space cholesterol. - [Andrew] see. - least suggest
us, again, taking lot leaps here, maybe high desmosterol,
high desmosterol, not good thing. kind pieced together
years ago, like, yeah, just not going prescribe Clomid anymore.
switched HCG, used use sometimes instead Clomid,
cumbersome work with. needs refrigerated, much fragile
molecule. - Yeah, think talked once. almost like accidentally
knock little bottle, basically gone bad. - Yeah yeah. - Travel
challenging. - Can't travel it. needle, know, injection, Sub-Q.
easy administer, not IM anything like that, just hassle factor.
said, benefit Clomid does, preserves testicular function.
preserves testicular volume. So, know, body builders will often use
post-cycle therapy, way kind recover function. just use now
ongoing therapy guy still testicular reserve. - own, no
testosterone, no aromatase inhibitor, nothing. Just way crank bit
testosterone testes. Maybe additional estrogen also? - Yeah, HCG
different model. HCG just analog luteinizing hormone. basically like
giving luteinizing hormone. - going crush endogenous luteinizing hormone
levels, right, it's- - Actually, yeah. don't really see much impact
LH,

01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin

see endogenous testosterone production go down. Actually, no, correct that.
FSH LH will go high enough dose. Yep. - Just mention,


not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

not making recommendations, one supplement talked lot
publicly Fadogia agrestis, weird Nigerian shrub that- - talked
Tim's podcast. - Tim's podcast Joe's podcast, and, know,
bit backlash turn high doses, rodent studies, can
cause toxicity testes. lower doses, seem increase
luteinizing hormone. talking this, number people went there,
pre post blood work, consistent effect seems increase luteinizing
hormone. noticeable effect testicular size volume. lot people
take like, oh, know, balls getting bigger, get
excited something good happening. don't know long-term safety
efficacy something like Fadogia, whether not needs cycled- - Yeah,
also leery supplements space, least
using HCG, testosterone, like many years data. remember
many women using stuff reproductive medicine. So, know, think
FDA lot faults. think entire podcast devoted corruption
FDA mistakes made respect oversight in,
especially generic drugs. way regulated wild wild west nutty
supplement land. - Absolutely. think reason talking things like
Tongkat Fadogia provide intermediate discussion
correct things, no supplementation hormone therapy, going straight
hormone therapy. - Yeah, I- - sort like leap from, can't focus well,
Ritalin, right, without real diagnosis ADHD to, oh well, maybe things like
Alpha-GPC low doses nicotine, right? agree entirely. mean, sourcing
important. dosages worked empirically individual basis.
aren't randomized control trials. just aren't. - Yeah, and, know, kind
like seven, another Peter Principle, right. got lot patients come
practice and, know, intake, go drugs
supplements taking right now? And, know, lot people come in, not
taking anything, Peter, just, charge now, like tell think.
get lot people come like, going need extra
pages part documentation. - Right, people travel suitcase
can hear walk airport pills rattling. - give
patients little homework exercise, answer seven
questions every supplement take, spreadsheet talk


it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

it. basically just runs like, know, basically walking
logic take molecule? think many people,
that, sobering, right. kind of, lot will come back like,
know what, don't think can come reason along really rigorous line
thinking taking 80% stuff. - Well, know people, actually
know people, fanatic like red light testes,
sunning testes, putting ice packs testes. kind place.
number things people trying order increase testosterone
output testes pretty remarkable. said, among women
know, number things try promote longevity fertility,
particular skin health, hair health nail health, also kind outrageous.
Everything collagen red light therapies, may actually efficacy
certain cases. But. - interesting aside. - hunger there, right? - Oh
sure. One things hope gets lot attention use rapamycin
preserving ovarian health. animal literature pretty impressive, right?
mouse models, rapamycin will preserve ovarian life. so- - Interesting. - makes
sense, right. mean, totally makes sense potent GRo protective
molecule also preserve extend ovarian life, least mice.
love see clinical trials done women test hypothesis. - definitely want
come back this, 'cause key thing.

01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility

know lot people interested female fertility there, including male
partners. going back to, now understand don't prescribe clomiphene,
desmosterol, potential desmosterol link. testosterone
therapy? less, - Yeah. - less frequent, lower doses, less no estrogen inhibition
aromatase inhibition. - Yeah, only, using aromatase blocker, use
Arimidex do. just get estradiol range want. like see
30 50. sweet spot. don't know, say like third,
maybe a, not even third, say probably 20% men require micro dose
anastrozole get range. not. rather err side
little high little low. never really want 25, unless sometimes
just 25 is, is, fine. suppressing 25,


never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

never want zone. yes, TRT ultimately, know, giving
testosterone cypionate usually use. - Injectable, opposed cream
pellet. - Correct. used use pellets women, really adamant
convenience it, bunch reasons just, mostly not
never fan pellets men. - can't control dosages, in,
right? - Well, even know dose, yeah, obviously problem. don't
think, big difference putting pellet man woman.
putting estrogen pellet woman, like, big. putting
enough pellets man six months testosterone, two sums pellets
longer fingers. putting like V-shape. - [Andrew]
putting this? - putting gluteal fat. just morbid procedure,
don't think necessary. think know manage it, know,
sort injections, now- - [Andrew] Injections no big deal. - Yeah, well
especially now doing, Sub-Q injections anyway. not
IM, using five-eights inch one inch 25 gauge needle,
smallest needle can push oil through, twice week, depending on.
way, real needle-phobes use Xyosted, preloaded pen. -
men take HCG maintain fertility testicular size? -
want to. - Got it. - way, not like use TRT men who, don't
like use testosterone specifically men still want maintain fertility. just
steer away that. - total sperm count goes down. - Yeah, just say,
risk it. Like rather use HCG. - [Andrew] Yeah, just own. - Yeah, just wait
till done reproducing. Bank sperm, wait till done reproducing go
testosterone. - benefits, cautionary
notes appropriate TRT, meaning kind contour talking here.
lower dose yes no low estrogen control. People, generally people
report, feel? allow couldn't feel
before? terms markers look for? LDL, blood pressure,
water retention, acne, kinds things. things well? -
Yeah, depends doses, right? mean, again, using really low
doses, pretty rare patient hundred milligrams
week testosterone. think comparison, like bodybuilder easily take 500
thousand high growth phase. - know guys, go ballistic,
moderate levels testosterone cypionate, also taking


Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

Dianabols, Nandrolone, know, SARMs, bunch things. mean,
stacks kind ridiculous. mean, no disrespect sport, mean, people
dying like crazy sport right now. - [Peter] outside physiology. - Yeah,
think 99% people listening, look, hear bodybuilder just go, like,
somebody anyway? - [Peter] Right. - think typical
response. - point is, lot of, owe guys great deal gratitude
'cause shown us boundaries. - Including women. - right, yeah,
yeah. so, bodybuilders taught us lot like happens.
yeah, bloating, water retention, acne, hair loss, hair growth, things
understand. truth is, just don't see things patients. -
hundred milligrams per week low output. understanding- -
physiologic dose. mean, reality enough people. mean there's,
probably highest ever go maybe 70 twice week. -
youngest patient ever put TRT? - Actual testosterone? - Mm hmm. -
Probably, good question, thinking about. Maybe 40. - think great
people hear, 'cause know lot guys 20s thinking TRT way
go, argue unless everything else right still
hypogonadal really struggling, put time off. also fertility
issue want delay, delay, delay. - Well, again, depends if, say TRT,
20s no way, hope steered toward
HCG least preserve testicular function. Now again, don't actually know
HCG 10 years, pituitary will still work. - Right, won't able
make luteinizing hormone. - Exactly. So, might case going
need something upstream that, like Clomid, kick start it, we're,
again, don't want anybody listening using Clomid fertility, think
anything wrong it. was, concern became like,
going 10 years, problematic? Not using course
IVF something like that. So, again, felt someone's pituitary not working,
happy put three months Clomid kind try see
blast back. - men cycle off testosterone low dosages?
taking month vacation every while? - Yeah, totally depends.
know, talking patient yesterday going do, just decided
change cycle, eight weeks on, eight weeks HCG, eight weeks on,
eight weeks HCG. going cycle maintains testosterone level,


fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

fluctuates endogenous, exogenous, endogenous, exogenous. Sometimes
just testosterone on, off, on, off. like, much can replenish
naturally, understanding T will dip off cycles. - Seems
tremendous incentive somebody develop molecule can directly target
SHBG, besides Oxandrolone Anavar, right? one just drop SHBG just
tiniest bit, seems like one adjust free T way great. don't
know molecule's hard target, somebody it. chemistry
can't - Yeah, funny. - hard. - talked Patrick Arnold many,
many years ago. wish remember ID, comment
time made sense, don't remember was, 'cause thought too,
like man. Especially subset guys normal testosterone,
just binding it. - really glad brought issue

01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone

total testosterone versus free T, reason is, ever since going podcasts
talking stuff, talking podcast, people will send
numbers. send charts send photos themselves,
can tell you, not clinician haven't done fancy statistics it,
little correlation someone's absolute testosterone appear. mean,
guys look, know, really lean, really strong, say, oh, total
testosterone 550, 480, right. people, know, testosterone 860,
look think, oh, kind kind dough-y look them.
got free testosterone thing, plus estrogen, et cetera.
cosmetically- - Well, also training nutrition too, right. - Yeah, absolutely. - mean,
just think, think talk testosterone, enjoy talking and,
know, enjoy talking data on, know, long-term health consequences
testosterone, 'cause another controversial topic, also think people kind overstate
importance. - [Andrew] agree. - think group people think
just fix testosterone, everything will better. sort like, no, actually
not true all. Really, purpose mind fixing testosterone give
capacity work harder. really going help recover
workouts. just give greater ability experience muscle protein
synthesis. So, know, just give bunch testosterone sit


couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

couch nutrition doesn't change not exercising anymore, not
going experience benefits thing. mean, testosterone level
fluctuated quite bit throughout life. think adult, not sort
including sort fanatical teenager, adult,
absolute insane physique, like best performance DEXA scan, would've
been, 38-years-old, DEXA 7% body fat. fat free mass index like
23.2, 23.3 kilograms per meter squared. mean, huge, strong, totally ripped.
testosterone toilet. over-training like crazy. was, know,
exercising probably 26 hours week, killing gym, swimming like banshee,
cycling like life depended it, grossly over-trained, low T, but, know, mean
physically looked like twice guy today. know, today T's probably twice
high then. So, know, now say, well, Peter, took T
back then? much better been? Sure. But, again, think take
home just giving somebody T doesn't much anything. probably helps
insulin resistance front, without thing. waste, like
squandering gift giving you, ability work and,
know, capture benefit via muscle protein synthesis. - agree, think
psychological effect testosterone, whether not exogenous endogenous,
makes effort feel good. - Yeah. - level really seems that. Sapolsky
tells main reason, mechanistically main reason can
adjusting levels activity amygdala. - Interesting. -
interesting imaging there.

02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B

love chat cholesterol pathway, know huge landscape
well, think good job diving deep, not getting stuck
underlying currents all. tremendous debate whether not dietary
cholesterol directly relates to, not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL HDL.
my- - there? - think, well, let put way. people argue,
certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - people argue one
eats ton saturated fat, LDL goes HDL goes down. - Oh, okay,
not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but,
people argue that, know, increase saturated fat intake going


bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

bad, already synthesize enough cholesterol hormone production, et cetera.
like talk terms one read charts. LDL
told healthy range. HDL told healthy range. try not
overeat things like butter, cheese, red meat, eat things
feel pretty good. people operating assumption eating
saturated fat bad, insofar want taste it. course
small group people love eat organs meats, really pack
cholesterol, argue doesn't matter LDL 870, not going
impact health. reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated
fat, least view? - first differentiate cholesterol fat, just
listener, 'cause use them, know, want make sure people understand. So,
cholesterol really complicated molecule. ringed molecule. God, used
know exactly structure was, like 36 carbons, remember.
lipid, hydrophobic molecule synthesized every cell human
body. important without it, look sort genetic conditions impair
cholesterol synthesis, depending severity, can fatal utero.
words, anything really interferes ability produce cholesterol, threat
us species. reason cholesterol makes cell membrane
every cell body. So, know, know, maybe listeners don't, even
though cell spherical thing, fluid, right? not just rigid like sphere,
like a, know, blow ball, right? got able kind move way
mesh cells. also accommodate porous structures traverse
membrane allow ions things like go across. cholesterol
gives fluidity membrane. also, alluding to, backbone
important hormones body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
cortisol. thing, super important. Okay. talk about, can get
cholesterol diet? Yes, can eat foods rich cholesterol.
known 1960, somehow escaped everybody's imagination finally American
Heart Association acknowledged years ago, cholesterol eat
not really make body. reason esterified.
have, not get nerdy, think people, really think important people
understand thing works. cells gut, enterocytes,
endothelial cells gut. have, one basically two
transporters them. first called Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.


second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

second called ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. Niemann-pick C1-like 1
transporter will bring sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. sterol fits
door will come in. Virtually cholesterol produce gets
taken back liver, liver packages bile secretes. aids
digestion, another thing should've mentioned earlier. addition using
cholesterol cell membranes hormones, wouldn't able digest food
without cholesterol, makes bile salts. cholesterol
basically recirculated pool throughout body, way gets back
body. Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. gets there,
body, checkpoint regulation. body says,
enough cholesterol body, yes no? yes, will let cholesterol make way
circulation. it'll go off basolateral side cell, not luminal side,
body. Alternatively, body says, know what? enough cholesterol.
going let poop out. now ATP-binding cassette will shoot out, it'll go
back luminal side, away goes. cholesterol body not
esterified. doesn't big, bulky side chain attached it. cholesterol
eat esterified, esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass
Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, probably manage de-
esterify 10 15% dietary cholesterol. words, small amounts
dietary cholesterol make way circulation, represents small
fraction total body's pool cholesterol. Again, known, even Ancel
Keys, guy turned fat biggest boogeyman time. Ancel Keys
acknowledged 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role serum cholesterol.
Again, took American Heart Association another 60 years figure out.
even now acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol no bearing. -
pretty easy find studies, least people highly credentialed good
institutions, claiming eating saturated fat- - [Peter] Saturated fat's different. -
Saturated fat red meat, things rich cholesterol, specific, bad
us terms eventual LDL. - two different things. saturated fat
consumption many people will erase LDL cholesterol. important differentiate
the, saturated fat? saturated fat course fatty acid, just
people understand. Totally different molecule cholesterol. Cholesterol
complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, just long
chain fatty acid fully saturated, meaning no double bonds, can exist


isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

isolation. can exist triglyceride, triglycerides, or, know, phospho lipid,
sorts things like that. eat foods contain fat, basically three
distinctions fat. saturated, monounsaturated, one double bond,
polyunsaturated, two double bonds? observation eating saturated fat
raises cholesterol generally correct. again, now makes, going
start talking LDL, explain LDL is. another one
things just grossly misunderstood, it's, makes discussions
complicated. go back cholesterol problem, right? every cell
body makes cholesterol, almost without exception, make enough.
handful times, however, cell needs borrow cholesterol another
cell. Okay, this, right? sort of, playing God
minute want design system, able transport cholesterol
one cell another. logical place transport
circulation. problem circulation water. Plasma water. now
problem, is, want transport cargo hydrophobic, hydrophilic
medium. Can't it. think things transport blood,
sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, water soluble. easy. just
move back forth blood no chaperone. want move
cholesterol, package something hydrophilic. something
called lipoprotein. spherical molecules lipid inside,
protein outside, lipoprotein, inside contain cholesterol triglycerides.
now got spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol inside,
chaperoned hydrophilic molecule allows move circulation.
lipoproteins exist different densities. run gel
electrophoresis plate, identify different densities. density function
much protein much lipid it. highest density called high
density lipoprotein, lowest density called low density lipoprotein,
VLDL. next LDL, low density lipoprotein, next
IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein. So, know, actually
goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, anyway. people say LDL high, LDL
100, saying? saying cholesterol concentration LDL
particles hundred milligrams per deciliter. total cholesterol concentration
circulation number says total cholesterol. someone's blood
panel says total cholesterol's 200, means take lipoproteins


circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat

state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy

answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned

circulation, bust open measure cholesterol content, 200 milligrams per
deciliter. intents purposes, IDLs short-lived,
basically sum LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol. three things sum total cholesterol. - LDL little
mentioned earlier? - [Peter] LP little another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah,
yeah, another actor. special type LDL that, again, sort 10 20%
population, really bad actor. LDL another apolipoprotein
called apolipoprotein little a. - [Andrew] Got it. - thing just say this,
earlier mentioned ApoB. two broad families lipoproteins.
wrapped ApoBs, wrapped ApoAs. ApoA
family HDL family. ApoB family VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - see.
somebody say total cholesterol is, just stay 200 simplicity.
like see terms HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. care
ApoB. care ApoB. care causative agent atherosclerosis.
ApoB thing drives atherosclerosis. - levels attractive repulsive
see levels ApoB blank, get really concerned? -
depends person's objectives. again, take different view. mean,
have. - Vitality now, want live hundred. - Yeah, see- -
assuming taper. - tell want live hundred, going
need keep ApoB 30 milligrams per deciliter. - say want live
hundred, also, well, about, don't care long live, want feel great
live. - Again, depends, right? Like anybody heart attack going
compromised ability feel well after. Right, so. - guess, say way,
going tell order achieve live hundred level,
going give personal life my- - No no, get- - brain
functioning, not really interested. - Sure, get LDL levels, really, again,
people think LDL, really ApoB, right? ApoB total concentration LDL
VLDL. matters. big atherogenic particles. LDL also
includes Lp[a], although concentration Lp[a] relatively speaking small
doesn't generally show much ApoB. treat ApoB, basically
comes want ApoB close level
born. start developing heart disease born. just way is.
autopsy studies make abundantly clear. look autopsies young
people dying 20s, first done 1970s,


repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away
it. lifelong disease. also know disease can't really
develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-
resistance, carbohydrate intake, triglycerides. we, mean clinically,
readily apparent anyone treats patients. restrict carbohydrates, will
reduce triglycerides. just happens day long. reduce triglycerides
raising fat intake much, can still raise ApoB. able think
it. ideal world, can lower saturated fat, tends one
driving ApoB, lowering carbohydrate, see can get.
reality is, nobody dietary intervention going get
level 30 milligrams per deciliter. mean, never seen anything. - Pure dietary
intervention. - Yeah. - things that- - [Peter] got
pharmacologic point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now multiple
classes drugs. tried true statin. statins work inhibiting
cholesterol synthesis, net effect the, liver really sensitive
cholesterol levels. doesn't want much, doesn't want little. inhibit


cholesterol synthesis, liver says, want cholesterol. puts LDL
receptors surface, pulls LDL circulation. lowers
LDL circulation. So, know, again, nine statins use today, typically use
four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,

incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around

repeated. Again, always done war, right? 1970s,
done people, know, died Vietnam. early 2000s done
mostly young men, young women, were, know, dying Iraq
Afghanistan. saw without ambiguity cardiovascular disease already
taking hold people 18, 19, 20-years-old. - [Andrew] Wow! - clear,
aren't going die atherosclerosis age. still 40, 50 years away

develop ApoB reaches certain threshold. threshold us
get time sort teens. really young ApoB level kind
20 30 milligrams per deciliter, makes impossible get atherosclerosis.
ApoB necessary, not sufficient develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh,
sorry, just going ask,

02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Cholesterol Prescriptions

top behavioral nutritional supplementation, any, based,
prescription drug-based ways target ApoB? - Well, nutritionally, basically
two big tools, right? depends driving ApoB. ApoB, remember,
concentration LDL VLDL particles. carry? Cholesterol
triglycerides. anything reduces cholesterol reduces triglycerides, going
reduce ApoB. Triglycerides generally driven carbohydrate intake. insulin-

four them. side effect profile, contrary kind sort statin-hating
propaganda there, benign, right? 5% people experience muscle soreness,
reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, think it's, terms actual
comparing placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. mean put
patient it, won't complain something? No, look clinical trials,
no evidence whatsoever statins impair cognition. also no evidence
clinical trials accelerate risk neurodegenerative disease. fact,
opposite. Now will, nuanced case make, Andrew, look
patients highly suppressed desmosterol levels. will back off. want
maintain desmosterol certain level, evidence still,
think, preliminary, enough us say, take chance?
many tools lower cholesterol, over-suppress synthesis
susceptible individual? next tool look drug blocks absorption,
reabsorption cholesterol. Remember Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter?
guy drug called ezetimibe just mechanically blocks it. people,
mentioned earlier, measure sterols people, also
measure things called phytosterols. phytosterols give us indication
active transporter is. higher phytosterols, likely
respond ezetimibe. Next class drugs drug blocks cholesterol synthesis,
liver. statin globally. drug called bempedoic acid
liver. similar mechanism statins. Different enzyme.
Not quite potent, way fewer side effects. patient response
statins adverse, try thing. - called, one time? -
[Peter] Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - potent drug lot
PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9, protein discovered late '90s, believe,
responsible degradation LDL receptors. first discovered people
condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, FH. people
incredibly high cholesterol. Typically total cholesterol level 300.
LDL cholesterol typically, know, north 200 milligrams per deciliter.
disease defined phenotype, not genotype. phenotype
clear definition, basically just gave you. genotype is, million paths


get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

get there. 3000 mutations known produce phenotype.
discovered one them. people hyper functioning PCSK9,
protein just constantly hammering destroying LDL receptors.
LDL huge. extension, total cholesterol be. 19, no
sorry, 2006, Helen Hobbs colleagues discovered opposite group population.
People LDL cholesterol naturally 10 20 milligrams per deciliter,
ApoB 20 milligrams per deciliter, never got heart disease.
immune heart disease, no matter long live.
opposite, hypofunctioning PCSK9. 2006 "New England
Journal Medicine." basically got whole bunch drug companies hot trail
producing drug mimic it. now antibodies, wildly
effective. - percentage patients 45 either statin
one classic compounds? - Well, often combinations, say
80%. - [Andrew] Eight zero? - Well remember objective is. Like,
business trying make sure people live long possible.
take sort world view this, right? you, like prevalent
cause death globally? - [Andrew] Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, like,
close it? last year COVID, COVID kind messes numbers
little bit, go 2019, 18.6 million people died heart disease. Number two,
cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's zip code atherosclerosis. remember
just said, took everybody 20s reduced level
child, make ASCVD orphan disease. - So. - question can
that? - don't hear more, don't hear this? realize
nuance. not straightforward, not simple saying, eat less cheese, red
meat watch LDL, get statin. hear little ApoB,
general discussion? Social media skewed landscape, know. People
shouting tunnels varying clarity. beautiful bronze tunnels clean
walls others sewer lines, right. converge place. - Yeah.
- Right, know. hear little this? mean, not statin,
now beginning think maybe might good idea consider one
compounds. don't know last time looked ApoB specifically,
guessing physician did. don't hear this?

02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk



sounds important. sounds like important conversation, 'cause
hormone stuff stuff smoking, head injuries, ADHD
rest, mean, irrelevant dead, right? - Yeah. great question, don't think
great insight isn't front center. think bigger problem
don't even understand think it? mean the, whole
chapter book working really gets problem of, aren't
looking atherosclerosis terms treating causative agent? Instead, look
modifying 10-year risk. fundamental difference call
medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, generally practicing
today, comes ASCVD says, look, will treat you, will lower LDL
cholesterol, still don't talk ApoB, American thing. go
outside United States, everybody's talking ApoB, guidelines
Europe Canada, everywhere else. United States stubborn this,
due couple really weird personalities lipid world. paradigm
is, 10-year risk reaches 5%, 5% chance going
heart attack, stroke, die next 10 years, now time treat you.
Medicine 3.0 says not way think it. treat causative agent.
causative agent, treat it. blood pressure raises risk heart disease,
lower blood pressure. smoking raises risk something, treat smoking.
reason risk model bad looking 10-year risk, age
biggest driver risk. mean bar none, right? take 70-year-old
perfect lipids perfect blood pressure perfect everything, 10-year risk
ASCVD probably four five times higher unhealthy 30-year-old. not
even close. - lot like eye disease. know, exceptions, course,
always say biggest risk factor going blind glaucoma older
person, frankly. - identify risk factors glaucoma, imagine
paradigm was, going treat risk blindness reaches 5%,
isn't triggered old enough anyway. Wouldn't rather know
30? - Absolutely. - say, wait, maybe sun without sunglasses,
or, know, using type eye drop something like that, negative impact,
rather know sooner. fundamental difference. philosophical
difference, respect prevention. will acknowledge one element
prevention, make no consideration. coming lens


individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know
trying solve really complicated problems, can simplify better.
just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.
But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless

But, know, sort knew point, like, going fixed.
sort went rabbit hole like, hey, anything can avoid
surgery? know, infusing million stem cells work? speaking
many orthopedic surgeons could, answer kind unambiguously no.
way, doesn't mean wouldn't feel better injected bunch stem cells
shoulder. lot reasons might make feel better. Just like
bunch reasons can feel better somebody injects saline directly
joint. question is, going fix underlying problem, so, will
mechanism? pretty sure took thousand people
particular injury, injected stem cells, wouldn't thing,
nature injury. complete labral tear. injuries might
benefit it? Yeah, possible. question is, design trial


narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small
molecules can replicate protective benefits exercise,
combine exercise? treatments disease states,
like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively
untapped, think potentially next sort frontier.

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

individual. never coming lens society. makes life
easier, makes problem solving easier. don't answer quality
adjusted life year problem. don't ask question, economical treat
people 30? don't know answer question. also know

just acknowledged openly, not solving that, want criticize it, fine.
transparent. care person sitting across from,
situation, really decision can justify cost treatment.

02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury
Rehabilitation

- esoteric question, less esoteric question. esoteric question relates
something think little bit niche, not necessarily so, is, peptides
stem cells PRP. don't want go off much tangent rehab, know
done number posts social media recently were, just tell
really thoughtful, really appreciate willing share tissue
rehabilitation experience, point people that, landscape lot
people don't know navigate it. mutual friend ours, not
named, sent text said, going talking Attia,
know studies things like BPC-157, gastric peptide anecdotally, again,
anecdotally, people report getting injections shoulder, knee, et cetera,
feeling much better, much faster, really aren't good studies, controlled
studies. hear sorts things platelet-rich plasma, PRP,
which, someone tells lot stem cells them, lying.
not lot stem cells them. also hear stem cells, not FDA
approved, least this, uses country, certainly, people
flying Colombia getting injections. understanding
experience things like BPC-157, specifically, 'cause peptides huge landscape.
probably whole episode peptides. Things like PRP. PRP now
approved for, mean, women getting injections ovaries improve
follicle count. know this. People getting injections PRP every tissue
organ and, hell, men getting injected penis, hear, sorts
reasons unclear me. deal PRP, BPC-157, stem cells?


ever see interesting effects? curious compounds?
prescribe direct people towards these? FDA approved ones course. - Yeah,
short answer is, definitely curious love see work done,
also think wild wild west gets. PRP less so, certainly stem cells
peptides. And, know, just think, going something without
clinical trial, got show lot data, right? use rapamycin
example, right? huge proponent rapamycin. can say, well, Peter,
can take prescribe rapamycin GRo protective effects, not
human clinical trial demonstrating lengthens life? answer is,
84 pieces data point direction across every model
organism going back billion years. really different from, Joey,
Sammy, Sally thing, think works. just can't compared.
Now no idea stem cells work. no idea BPC-157 works. no idea,
frankly, PRP even works, though might seem efficacy
indications. example, maybe comes early hair loss. Maybe comes
to, know, certain joint issues. reality like, think just accept
fact everything opportunity cost, opportunity cost
sometimes financial. actually find lot times time effort energy
goes something. Now, was, know, waiting get shoulder
surgery, injury forever, right? injury, know,
injury actually probably greatest source discomfort swimming
Catalina Channel last time 2009. tells long injury.

even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
health span parts it. both, right? small

like diabetes, things like that? think field metabolomics relatively

02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss

- Speaking frontiers, hear lot nowadays GLP-1 pharmacology,
prescription drugs mimic increase GLP-1 directly, glucagon-like peptide. People
talking blockbuster obesity drug. haven't heard much talk
drug adjust human body weight favorably, since discussions fen-phen
college, course fen-phen pulled market
people dying. Not left right, enough people died pulled
market. - Which, way, interesting story. know, enantiomer
chose use wrong enantiomer. resulted was, God,
think like. - mitral valve prolapse? - MVP, yeah,
something mitral valve. Yeah, think chordae tendineae rupturing
mitral valve, mostly young women think getting, know, horrible
pulmonary disease result it. Probably pulmonary hypertension something like
that. were, know, two enantiomers drug,
just used one, issue wouldn't happened. stupid
reason made choice use one did. one things
make mistake, never going back. not like company


say, okay, wait, want over, going right version.
tragic outcome. absolutely right. think GLP-1 agonists
efficacy, and, know, intensity everything can see, certainly
seem safer. - excited them? - Yeah, am, yeah. mean, think just
seeing kind tip iceberg. not miracle drugs, right. come
problems, right, is, know, catabolic across board. patients
losing fat, losing muscle well. So, know- - just sent gym
jockeys running [indistinct], say. say nowadays
something going drop testosterone, lower fertility, change someone's
skin, hair nails, like people, extend life 250-years-old
people gone. Humans humans. neuroscience psychology issue, not
biology medicine issue. pleased hear excited them, 'cause
hear lot excitement. haven't heard anything disastrous them. - takes
get people dose. looking semaglutide, dose
studied, one-year trial, maybe little that, maybe 60 weeks.
took 16 weeks get patients comfortably 2.4 milligrams weekly,
dose ultimately stayed on. experience, use it, don't
even usually go 2.4 milligrams. can usually get enough benefit one
two milligrams. usually move people along little bit quicker.
definitely share patients can't tolerate due nausea. - Interesting. -
might part working, right, sort suppression appetite,
which, taken extreme can produce nausea. - Interesting. - Yeah, think
effect semaglutide central, not peripheral. - Huh. don't know, saw one
paper GLP-1 acting cells periphery, cause gut distention
ways, sort make people feel full, promotion literally mechanical receptors
make people feel stomach distended, even though stomach
empty. perhaps central hypothalamic effects. what- - Yeah, think
doing, bet 80% hypothalamus. also improving insulin
sensitivity periphery, don't think accounting much benefit. -
Super interesting. - next gen versions seem long-
lasting. right now, look coming off semaglutide, going see weight
regain. newer versions seem preserve weight loss, even off
drug. begs ultimate question, like, total use case
going be? going drug cycle off? going drug


person stay indefinitely, so, will become tachyphylactic? Will
gain resistance it? still super early days things. - hope
little bit like way describe testosterone estrogen therapies,
allow people behavioral work absolutely required
health span lifespan. - Yep, also seen, flip side that, can
cheat semaglutide, right? can drink lot calories, sort get around
drug. So, know, example, like, know, always encourage patients
want lose weight really just eliminate alcohol. like, cheapest,
easiest trick lose weight. still drinking lot alcohol,
incredibly caloric, just drinking lot caloric stuff, seen less,
just anecdotal patients, seen that's, easier get around
benefits drug way. - Interesting. appreciate answers today. First
all, incredibly thorough pointed towards real world application. also just
want thank broadly work do, obviously
incredible clinical experience patient population work closely with.
see really one few, clinicians, realize MD,
PhD well? No, consider scientist clinician, clinician scientist
appropriate wording course, way really still drill studies
detail. know lot clinicians, not sure. fact
hungry new incoming knowledge, well old literature. So,
incredibly rich data set brain yours, really appreciate sharing
us, podcast, upcoming book, think certainly
anticipation that. know I, ton people, really
excited book. way approach social media podcast
going podcasts. thank much. learned ton, know everyone learned
ton. - Thanks Andrew. Great here, man. - Thank you.

narrow patient population correctly, might see signal? 'Cause
risk trial much heterogeneous patient
population. don't know heck really doing, get meaningless
results. get null result, fact small signal,
underpowered pick because, know, 10% patient
population right patient population get that. So, know, will ever
get there? don't know, don't see incentive is, right. people
making money hand fist, procedures basis not sure
what, motivation incentive sort see legitimized?
really able say, well, really needs sort pharma angle this.
sort one wishes had, right? Like billionaire, feel like way
probably waste money running clinical trials stuff nobody
cared about. - Yeah. - just be- - Likewise, will join you, be,
yesterday recorded sit somebody Caltech works
aggression rage, things related that, identified peptides
approved FDA reasons seem adjust anxiety, might even adjust
aggression pathologic aggression, went off long description none
drugs exist market treatment psychiatric illness, yet
probably work. missing billionaire, billion dollar company,
willing invest something likely will work, market value isn't quite
there. failed previous trial, no one wants touch 10-foot pole.
Hopefully someone listening will incentivized provide sort venue
that. kind work talking about. ask. - want make one
point, Andrew, is, me, problem lot things gets,
crutch. know, sort like talked like, hey, just fix T man,
everything's going fine. like, no, just beginning. know,
worry see people clamoring stuff lot times
don't realize that, whether psychologically otherwise, sort say, well,
now thing done, don't hard work real rehab.
mean, learned anything shoulder surgery, now 3 1/2 months
out. - feel? - Amazing. mean, look, still can't lot stuff. going
be, know, while. haven't even able shoot bow yet. it'll probably
year go back to, know, long dead hangs heavy deadlifts. mean,
dunno, maybe nine months. it's, know, not yet. learned


really amazing prehab rehab process is, like just got work,
freaking hard. Shoulders tedious, boring thing world. mean,
three days week doing, four days week one hour just dedicated
stuff shoulder, super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But,
mean, faith methodology, right. think lot people saying, just
shoot stem cells don't stuff. reality
is, think dangerous place be. - ever tried BPC-157? - Yeah,
tried it. had, know, again, maybe seven, eight years ago, bunch
patients ask it, so, know, view is, okay, pretty convinced
no safety downside like, well, wouldn't prescribe patient unless
tried myself. another doc practice, Ralph, for, don't know,
couple months. didn't notice single thing. - Interesting.

02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise

Well, thank that. Shifting less esoteric, but, think probably
important topic overall. Metabolomics. talking sat
record. is, metabolomics? thinking them?
idea might about, people think not thinking
metabolomics all. are, sure learn more. tell us
metabolomics like see world metabolomics. -
Yeah, omics just term use describe study something.
genomics right, like broad study genes, and, know, proteomics, broad
study proteins things like that. metabolomics just study metabolites,
metabolites, unlike lot things, relatively finite number
things, many known, not known. glucose
metabolite. Acetyl-CoA metabolite. Lactate metabolite. question is,
know things work? importantly,
know certain physiologic states, metabolomic profile results
them? use two extreme examples, like exercise. Everybody understands,
data unambiguously clear, exercise produces favorable phenotype
imaginable. wanted take genomics approach understanding that,
might look at, change genome exercise? answer
probably not, maybe looked methylation patterns epigenome,


look epigenomic studies. might instead look kind proteomic
side that. Like, gene expression doing? see lot
changes. Well, don't think people really understanding, although
interesting paper just came two weeks ago looks novel metabolites
changing, huge signal metabolomic profile looks different
state exercise versus non-exercise. represent part exercise
transmitting benefit body? know, people always talk holy
grail metabolomics can find pill mimic exercise? think
answer question going undoubtedly no. couple reasons. One,
even mimic longevity sort lifespan parts it, never mimic
